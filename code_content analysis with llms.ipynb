MOSCOW, November 1. /TASS/. \\n\\nAn increasing number of people around the world not only sympathize with Russia, but also view it as a defender of enduring traditions and strong values, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at the World Thematic Conference of Russian Compatriots Living Abroad.\\n\\n\\\"Russia as a civilization state will continue to uphold the moral foundations of international relations and to promote the principles of honesty, truth, good and justice in international affairs. Reliance on the ideals that are shared by the main religions and cultures, respect for the identities of nations and their right to their own development paths are major factors in searching for the best answers to the numerous modern-day challenges and threats. This creative policy enjoys broad support in the international community. A growing number of people, including in Europe, not only have a liking for Russia but also regard it as the defender of enduring traditions and real values,\\\" the minister said.\\n\\nLavrov emphasized that domestic diplomacy, relying on the unique experience accumulated by Russian people from all walks of life living in peaceful harmony, \\\"will continue to consistently advocate a peaceful, positive and balanced agenda in the interests of promoting conflict resolution and creating a fairer architecture of international relations, which should reflect the diversity and stability of the modern world and ensure the best possible external conditions for the internal development of\\\" Russia.\\n\\nThe Russian foreign minister drew attention to the fact that Western countries are eroding traditional values and rewriting the basic norms of morality. \\\"They are aggressively encouraging all-permissiveness, tolerance taken to the point of absurdity and various destructive patterns of behavior. They are adopting bans on religious symbols. The EU pretends not to see blasphemous actions with regard to Muslim relics and the destruction of Orthodoxy, which is no exaggeration,\\\" Lavrov noted. \\\"This policy is being conducted contrary to the aspirations of the majority of people, is doing irreparable damage to their moral health, is eroding their civilizational roots and leading to disengagement, depersonalization and the self-destruction of society. The worst effect of this is the growth of radicalism, aggressive nationalism, xenophobia and intolerance,\\\" the foreign minister added.\\n\\nLavrov also pointed out that the ongoing attempts to impose these so-called values which are alien to other peoples by the neo-liberal elite in the West are deeply disturbing.\",\n          \"Title: Towards a Multipolar, Fair World Order. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov arrived in the Chinese district of Tunx for talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that amid the current, serious stage in the history of international relations, Russia and China will move to a multipolar, fair world order.\\u201cWe are going through a very serious stage in the history of international relations. I am convinced that as a result of this stage, the international situation will become clearer significantly and we will move together with you, together with our other like-minded people, towards a multipolar, just, democratic world order,\\u201d he said.Russia is interested in developing relations with China steadily and consistently, Lavrov added.\\u201cWe are interested in our relations with China continuing to develop steadily and consistently. Our leaders, President Putin and President Xi Jinping, have agreed on this. Today we will consider specific steps aimed at ensuring that all these agreements are consistently implemented,\\u201d the foreign minister stressed.Lavrov also drew attention to the fact that this is already his second meeting with his Chinese counterpart, which underlines the intensity and confidential nature of the regular dialogue.In turn, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a meeting with Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday that relations between Russia and China since the beginning of the year have withstood new tests.\\u201cSince the beginning of this year, Chinese-Russian relations have withstood new tests of serious changes in the international situation, and have maintained the right direction and a steady development trend,\\u201d Wang Yi said.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi have noted the counterproductiveness of illegal unilateral sanctions imposed against Russia by the US and its allies during talks in China, the Russian foreign ministry said.\\u201cThe sides noted the counterproductive nature of the illegal unilateral sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and its satellites,\\u201d the ministry said in a statement.The ministers also discussed the situation on the Korean Peninsula during the meeting, the statement added.Sergei Lavrov is in China on a two-day visit, during which he will take part in the third ministerial conference between Afghanistan and the expanded \\u201ctroika\\u201d on Afghanistan (Russia, China, the United States and Pakistan).SputnikNews| Sputnik International\\u2019s predecessors are the state-run news agency RIA Novosti and the Voice of Russia radio service, which were disbanded in 2013.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"gpt_topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"lgbtq rights in russia\",\n          \"traditional values\",\n          \"russia-belarus relations\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

MOSCOW, November 1. /TASS/. \\n\\nAn increasing number of people around the world not only sympathize with Russia, but also view it as a defender of enduring traditions and strong values, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at the World Thematic Conference of Russian Compatriots Living Abroad.\\n\\n\\\"Russia as a civilization state will continue to uphold the moral foundations of international relations and to promote the principles of honesty, truth, good and justice in international affairs. Reliance on the ideals that are shared by the main religions and cultures, respect for the identities of nations and their right to their own development paths are major factors in searching for the best answers to the numerous modern-day challenges and threats. This creative policy enjoys broad support in the international community. A growing number of people, including in Europe, not only have a liking for Russia but also regard it as the defender of enduring traditions and real values,\\\" the minister said.\\n\\nLavrov emphasized that domestic diplomacy, relying on the unique experience accumulated by Russian people from all walks of life living in peaceful harmony, \\\"will continue to consistently advocate a peaceful, positive and balanced agenda in the interests of promoting conflict resolution and creating a fairer architecture of international relations, which should reflect the diversity and stability of the modern world and ensure the best possible external conditions for the internal development of\\\" Russia.\\n\\nThe Russian foreign minister drew attention to the fact that Western countries are eroding traditional values and rewriting the basic norms of morality. \\\"They are aggressively encouraging all-permissiveness, tolerance taken to the point of absurdity and various destructive patterns of behavior. They are adopting bans on religious symbols. The EU pretends not to see blasphemous actions with regard to Muslim relics and the destruction of Orthodoxy, which is no exaggeration,\\\" Lavrov noted. \\\"This policy is being conducted contrary to the aspirations of the majority of people, is doing irreparable damage to their moral health, is eroding their civilizational roots and leading to disengagement, depersonalization and the self-destruction of society. The worst effect of this is the growth of radicalism, aggressive nationalism, xenophobia and intolerance,\\\" the foreign minister added.\\n\\nLavrov also pointed out that the ongoing attempts to impose these so-called values which are alien to other peoples by the neo-liberal elite in the West are deeply disturbing.\",\n          \"Title: Towards a Multipolar, Fair World Order. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov arrived in the Chinese district of Tunx for talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that amid the current, serious stage in the history of international relations, Russia and China will move to a multipolar, fair world order.\\u201cWe are going through a very serious stage in the history of international relations. I am convinced that as a result of this stage, the international situation will become clearer significantly and we will move together with you, together with our other like-minded people, towards a multipolar, just, democratic world order,\\u201d he said.Russia is interested in developing relations with China steadily and consistently, Lavrov added.\\u201cWe are interested in our relations with China continuing to develop steadily and consistently. Our leaders, President Putin and President Xi Jinping, have agreed on this. Today we will consider specific steps aimed at ensuring that all these agreements are consistently implemented,\\u201d the foreign minister stressed.Lavrov also drew attention to the fact that this is already his second meeting with his Chinese counterpart, which underlines the intensity and confidential nature of the regular dialogue.In turn, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a meeting with Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday that relations between Russia and China since the beginning of the year have withstood new tests.\\u201cSince the beginning of this year, Chinese-Russian relations have withstood new tests of serious changes in the international situation, and have maintained the right direction and a steady development trend,\\u201d Wang Yi said.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi have noted the counterproductiveness of illegal unilateral sanctions imposed against Russia by the US and its allies during talks in China, the Russian foreign ministry said.\\u201cThe sides noted the counterproductive nature of the illegal unilateral sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and its satellites,\\u201d the ministry said in a statement.The ministers also discussed the situation on the Korean Peninsula during the meeting, the statement added.Sergei Lavrov is in China on a two-day visit, during which he will take part in the third ministerial conference between Afghanistan and the expanded \\u201ctroika\\u201d on Afghanistan (Russia, China, the United States and Pakistan).SputnikNews| Sputnik International\\u2019s predecessors are the state-run news agency RIA Novosti and the Voice of Russia radio service, which were disbanded in 2013.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"gpt_source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"media outlet\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

MOSCOW, November 1. /TASS/. \\n\\nAn increasing number of people around the world not only sympathize with Russia, but also view it as a defender of enduring traditions and strong values, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at the World Thematic Conference of Russian Compatriots Living Abroad.\\n\\n\\\"Russia as a civilization state will continue to uphold the moral foundations of international relations and to promote the principles of honesty, truth, good and justice in international affairs. Reliance on the ideals that are shared by the main religions and cultures, respect for the identities of nations and their right to their own development paths are major factors in searching for the best answers to the numerous modern-day challenges and threats. This creative policy enjoys broad support in the international community. A growing number of people, including in Europe, not only have a liking for Russia but also regard it as the defender of enduring traditions and real values,\\\" the minister said.\\n\\nLavrov emphasized that domestic diplomacy, relying on the unique experience accumulated by Russian people from all walks of life living in peaceful harmony, \\\"will continue to consistently advocate a peaceful, positive and balanced agenda in the interests of promoting conflict resolution and creating a fairer architecture of international relations, which should reflect the diversity and stability of the modern world and ensure the best possible external conditions for the internal development of\\\" Russia.\\n\\nThe Russian foreign minister drew attention to the fact that Western countries are eroding traditional values and rewriting the basic norms of morality. \\\"They are aggressively encouraging all-permissiveness, tolerance taken to the point of absurdity and various destructive patterns of behavior. They are adopting bans on religious symbols. The EU pretends not to see blasphemous actions with regard to Muslim relics and the destruction of Orthodoxy, which is no exaggeration,\\\" Lavrov noted. \\\"This policy is being conducted contrary to the aspirations of the majority of people, is doing irreparable damage to their moral health, is eroding their civilizational roots and leading to disengagement, depersonalization and the self-destruction of society. The worst effect of this is the growth of radicalism, aggressive nationalism, xenophobia and intolerance,\\\" the foreign minister added.\\n\\nLavrov also pointed out that the ongoing attempts to impose these so-called values which are alien to other peoples by the neo-liberal elite in the West are deeply disturbing.\",\n          \"Title: Towards a Multipolar, Fair World Order. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov arrived in the Chinese district of Tunx for talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that amid the current, serious stage in the history of international relations, Russia and China will move to a multipolar, fair world order.\\u201cWe are going through a very serious stage in the history of international relations.

Our leaders, President Putin and President Xi Jinping, have agreed on this. Today we will consider specific steps aimed at ensuring that all these agreements are consistently implemented,\\u201d the foreign minister stressed.Lavrov also drew attention to the fact that this is already his second meeting with his Chinese counterpart, which underlines the intensity and confidential nature of the regular dialogue.In turn, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a meeting with Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday that relations between Russia and China since the beginning of the year have withstood new tests.\\u201cSince the beginning of this year, Chinese-Russian relations have withstood new tests of serious changes in the international situation, and have maintained the right direction and a steady development trend,\\u201d Wang Yi said.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi have noted the counterproductiveness of illegal unilateral sanctions imposed against Russia by the US and its allies during talks in China, the Russian foreign ministry said.\\u201cThe sides noted the counterproductive nature of the illegal unilateral sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and its satellites,\\u201d the ministry said in a statement.The ministers also discussed the situation on the Korean Peninsula during the meeting, the statement added.Sergei Lavrov is in China on a two-day visit, during which he will take part in the third ministerial conference between Afghanistan and the expanded \\u201ctroika\\u201d on Afghanistan (Russia, China, the United States and Pakistan).SputnikNews| Sputnik International\\u2019s predecessors are the state-run news agency RIA Novosti and the Voice of Russia radio service, which were disbanded in 2013.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1,\n          2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"gpt_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1,\n          2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Despite nearly one third of Ukraine\\u2019s population referring to Russian as its native language, the last 20 years have seen a deliberate shrinking of space.  Ukrainian authorities have stopped any study of Russian language, eliminated it from schools, removed books and prohibited those in higher education from speaking it, even in private.  There has also been a mass renaming of cities and streets; the destruction of monuments; and the seizure of churches.  \\u201cWe see an ideology of hatred for everything Russian, hatred of Russians, hatred of anyone who is somehow linked to Russia,\\u201d he underscored.\\n\\nDmitry Vasilets, Deputy Head of the Ukrainian Trade Union of Law Workers, noting that he speaks on behalf of the millions of Russian citizens in Ukraine, added that speaking Russian was prohibited in schools beginning in 2020 and then in movie theatres, public buildings and other locations since 2021.  \\u201cThat is barbarism that has been enshrined in law by [Ukraine President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy,\\u201d he stated, emphasizing that the use of one\\u2019s mother tongue is a human right protected under international law.  Citing various instances of discrimination, including on social media platforms, he declared that \\u201cthe Russian language is gradually being destroyed\\u201d.\\n\\nTimothy Snyder, Professor of History at Yale University, pointed out that the term \\u201cRussophobia\\u201d is an attempt to justify the Russian Federation\\u2019s war crimes in Ukraine.  The harm being done to Russians and Russian Federation culture is primarily due to Moscow\\u2019s own policies and actions, he countered, spotlighting the emigration of creative Russians due to its invasion of Ukraine; destruction of independent Russian journalism; attacks on culture, books, museums and other landmarks; mass killings of Russian speakers and citizens; and Russian Federation State television proclamations.  The claim that Ukrainians are sick with a disease called \\u201cRussophobia\\u201d is simply colonial rhetoric and part of a larger strategy of hate speech, he stressed.\\n\\nAs the floor opened for discussion, the representative of the Russian Federation said that his country convened today\\u2019s meeting to underscore the threat of Ukraine\\u2019s Russophobia to international peace and security.  What is happening now \\u2014 from language bans to book burnings \\u2014 is linguistic inquisition and obscurantism for which innocent people are suffering and dying.  A long-term and sustainable peace in Europe cannot be built on Russophobia, he underlined, emphasizing that no condemnation of Moscow\\u2019s special military operation by the West can explain the Russophobia in those countries.\\n\\nChallenging this assertion, Ukraine\\u2019s representative stressed that the mass graves in Bucha, Mariupol, Izium and other places have demonstrated the power of Moscow\\u2019s war propaganda in dehumanizing Ukrainians.  This is a real hatred that has been deliberately fuelled for decades; directed against Ukraine; and resulted in war crimes, crimes against humanity and the breaking of that country\\u2019s sovereignty.  In that regard, a future tribunal must establish accountability for all those who issued criminal orders and those who implemented and whitewashed them, he insisted.\\n\\nThe representative of Malta, asserting that today\\u2019s meeting is yet another cynical attempt to justify the unjustifiable, deplored Moscow\\u2019s dissemination of disinformation and misinformation.  Despite today\\u2019s narratives which aimed to portray the victim as the aggressor and the aggressor as the victim, the facts are clear for all to see, he said.  Moscow must stop its current war and the Council must redouble its efforts to ensure accountability and justice for victims.\\n\\nBrazil\\u2019s delegate pointed out that \\u201cthe mere repetition of national positions, in a format that shows clear signs of exhaustion, will contribute nothing to the end of the conflict\\u201d.  It would have been more productive to discuss pragmatic means to achieve peace, a concept that has been largely absent from the Council\\u2019s debates, he maintained.\\n\\nMozambique\\u2019s representative, Council President for March, speaking in his national capacity, warned parties against using toxic language.  Such language creates an atmosphere of fear and distrust; adds fuel to an already acrimonious and destructive conflict; and makes the prospect for peace all the more fragile.  \\u201cGiven the global visibility of the conflict, the charged rhetoric that has become common amongst the belligerents risks normalizing hatred and incitement in other parts of the globe,\\u201d he cautioned.\\n\\nIn a similar vein, the representative of the United Arab Emirates stressed that the hatred of any group strips away empathy at a time when understanding is most needed.  When the guns are eventually silenced, such intolerance and bigotry can hamper post-conflict reconciliation and sustainable peace.  Against this backdrop, the Council must redouble its efforts to address the proliferation of hate speech and intolerance as \\u201ca worldview that supports xenophobia serves no one\\u201d.\\n\\nBuilding on this, China\\u2019s delegate called on the international community to eliminate estrangement, prejudice and hatred.  When phobias are used as a policy pretext, countries magnify differences, create imaginary enemies, concoct threat theories and pursue suppression while dragging the world into a quagmire of conflicts and disputes.  Humanity is wise and capable enough to overcome these phobias by engaging in dialogue and tolerance instead of confrontation and exclusion, he said, emphasizing that \\u201ctogether, we can build a new type of international relations based on mutual respect, fairness and win-win cooperation\\u201d.\\n\\nAlso speaking today were representatives of Japan, Gabon, United Kingdom, France, Ecuador, Albania, Ghana, Switzerland and the United States.\\n\\nThe Russian Federation took the floor a second time and again in response to Mr. Snyder.\\n\\nThe meeting began at 10:06 a.m. and ended at 12:15 p.m.\\n\\nBriefings\\n\\nKIRILL VYSHINSKY, Executive Director of Rossiya Segodnya, noting that he was a journalist who worked in various Ukrainian media outlets, was arrested by security forces on a concocted pretext and went to the Russian Federation following his release, defined Russophobia as a demonstration and imposition of hostility against the Russian Federation\\u2019s people, its State and citizens.  This rejection of that civilization\\u2019s status and culture is being doing publicly on media outlets and the Internet in a targeted fashion.  Anyone who feels they are the Russian is having the right to life, dignity and free movement curtailed, he said before detailing several egregious examples of modern Ukrainian Russophobia.  Among other things, there was a misanthropic call on Ukrainian television for Russians to be dealt with by destroying their families and children; a Ukrainian doctor who urged the castration of war prisoners because they are \\u201ccockroaches rather than people\\u201d; and an advertisement where a Russian soldier\\u2019s throat was being cut as the words \\u201cnow we are exacting our bloody revenge on all of you\\u201d were said.\\n\\nThis is being implemented in practice, he stressed, noting that prisoners of war have faced atrocities and civilians have been shot in the Russian-speaking region of the Donbas.  In March, Ukraine announced a draft bill introducing the concept of Rashism.  There is also the forceful expulsion of the Russian people, lies being told against Moscow and open hatred of the Russian Federation and Russians not only in Ukraine, but also in other parts of the world, such as the European Union.  For example, Poland\\u2019s Prime Minister admitted in March 2022 that Russophobia was already the mainstream.\\n\\nRussians are the second most numerous community in Ukraine, numbering in the millions, he pointed out.  Nearly one third of the population \\u2014 over 14 million people \\u2014 refer to the Russian language as a native language.  Those who constantly speak Russian or use Russian are 53 per cent of the population.  Yet, over the last 20 years, there has been a deliberate shrinking of the sphere for the use of that language.  Discrimination against the Russian language is in the media and throughout the country, he asserted.  Ukrainian authorities have stopped any study of that language, eliminated it from schools and said they would remove a large number of books.  While books are not being burned demonstrably like the Nazis did in the 1930s, they are nevertheless being thrown into the trash.  Everyone in higher education cannot speak Russian \\u2014 not even in private \\u2014 and is being supported by Ukraine\\u2019s ombudsman who promised to broaden and introduce this practice to other institutions, he continued.\\n\\nHe then spotlighted other manifestations of Russophobia which included a humanitarian catastrophe resulting from the cessation of freshwater through Crimean channels; the mass renaming of cities and streets; the destruction of a number of monuments; and the attacks and seizures of churches.  \\u201cI could give you many facts about the Russophobia policies of the Ukrainian authorities \\u2014 they reached their peak in 2022 and 2023,\\u201d he said, adding:  \\u201cBut, the conclusion is simple:  recently Ukraine has seen systematic attempts in various areas of education, culture and the economy and everyday life.  We see an ideology of hatred for everything Russian, hatred of Russians, hatred of anyone who is somehow linked to Russia.\\u201d\\n\\nDMITRY VASILETS, Deputy Head of the Ukrainian Trade Union of Law Workers, noting that he speaks on behalf of the millions of Russian citizens in Ukraine, said that country\\u2019s Constitution enshrines the right to speak and use different languages, including Russian.  However, the criminal regime of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy represses the use of the Russian language.  Beginning in 2020, speaking Russian was prohibited in Ukrainian schools, and in 2021 and 2022, it began to be prohibited in movie theatres, public buildings and other locations across Ukraine.  Those found speaking Russian were even fined.  \\u201cThat is the barbarism that has been enshrined in law by Zelenskyy,\\u201d he stressed, noting that over 70 per cent of Ukrainians remain in favour of studying the Russian language in schools.  Emphasizing that the use of one\\u2019s mother tongue is a human right protected under international law, he described the situation in Ukraine as a case of \\u201clinguicide\\u201d.\\n\\nUrging the Council\\u2019s members to imagine not being allowed to speak or think in their own native language, he recounted his own experiences of being discriminated against for speaking Russian in Ukraine.  Today, against the backdrop of the war and great humanitarian need, even humanitarian aid is being withheld from those who need it, if those seeking it do not address the authorities in Ukrainian.  At least 30 per cent of Ukrainian citizens remain unable to use their own language.  Recalling the adoption of a law that enshrined the Ukrainian language as the country\\u2019s official State language, he said that move impacted other ethnic communities \\u2014 including Hungarians \\u2014 but hit Russian-speakers hardest.  He also noted that the use of some European languages, such as those spoken in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, is tolerated over the use of others.  Citing various specific instances of discrimination, including on social media platforms, he declared that \\u201cthe Russian language is gradually being destroyed\\u201d in Ukraine, which is totally unacceptable in the twenty-first century.\\n\\nTIMOTHY SNYDER, Professor of History at Yale University, describing himself as a historian of mass atrocities and other crimes, said the term \\u201cRussophobia\\u201d itself clarifies certain things about the war.  First, it shows that the harm being done to Russians and to Russian culture is primarily a matter of Moscow\\u2019s own policies and actions.  Indeed, the term \\u201cRussophobia\\u201d itself is a form of imperial propaganda and an attempt to justify Moscow\\u2019s war crimes in Ukraine.  Noting that he shares concerns over the harm being done to Russians today, he urged the Council to consider which actions over the past year have done the most harm to Russian people and culture.  First, Moscow\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has caused some of the most creative and productive Russians to emigrate away from the country.  Meanwhile, independent Russian journalism has been destroyed, \\u201cso that Russians cannot know the world around them\\u201d.  Citing a general trend towards censorship in the Russian Federation, he said that, in that country, hold a sign that reads \\u201cno to war\\u201d is likely to lead to imprisonment.\\n\\nHe went on to describe attacks on Russian culture through the destruction of books, museums and other cultural landmarks \\u2014 all parts of the Russian Federation\\u2019s own State policy \\u2014 and added that the idea of the \\u201cGreat Motherland War\\u201d has also been perverted by associating it with a war being fought in 2023.  He also drew attention to the mass killing of Russian speakers, and of the Russian Federation\\u2019s citizens, in Ukraine as a result of Moscow\\u2019s own invasion.  Meanwhile, a generation of young Russian fighters \\u2014 those that survive the war \\u2014 will have been involved in war crimes, and find themselves wrapped up in guilt for the rest of their lives.  However, he said, the very worst harm to the Russian people and culture is the State\\u2019s broad normalization of the idea of genocide.  Indeed, Russian State television continues to present Ukrainians as pigs, worms, Satanists and ghouls, and proclaim that Ukrainian children should be drowned.  \\u201cIf we were sincerely concerned about Russians, we would be concerned about what Russian State policy is doing to Russians,\\u201d he stressed.\\n\\nMoreover, he continued, the term \\u201cRussophobia\\u201d is part of a long-standing rhetorical strategy used by an empire when it attacks, claiming that it is, in fact, the victim.  Citing the obvious and massive destruction of Ukraine, he said the setting of a war matters.  The idea that the Russian Federation is the victim \\u2014 even as it carries out a war of atrocity in Ukraine \\u2014 is meant to distract from the experience of the real victims, in the real world.  Against that backdrop, he rejected Moscow\\u2019s assertion that \\u201cour hurt feelings count more than other people\\u2019s lives\\u201d.  The claim that Ukrainians are sick with a disease called \\u201cRussophobia\\u201d is simply a type of colonial rhetoric and part of a larger strategy of hate speech, he said.\\n\\nStatements\\n\\nVASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), requesting Mr. Snyder to provide examples, noted that his fairy tales and attempts at historical engineering shatter against historical facts.  In delivering a brief overview of history, he pointed out that Russophobia has become Ukraine\\u2019s bullwork ideology.  While 17.3 per cent of Ukraine\\u2019s population considered themselves as Russians in the 2001 census and 30 per cent refer to Russian as their native language, that country\\u2019s nationalist Government launched a brutal attack on all things Russian.  Authorities were ready to kill Russian-speaking Ukrainians as demonstrated by the burning of more than 40 Russian-speaking activists in Odessa in May 2014 and the quotes of several figures \\u2014 such as Dmitry Yarosh, the leader of the extremist Right Sector organization \\u2014 in the days following the coup d\\u2019\\u00e9tat of that year.  Ukraine\\u2019s attempt to repeal a law on its language policy notably provoked Crimea\\u2019s separation and protests among Donbas\\u2019 inhabitants.  For nine years, Ukrainian authorities have systematically destroyed everything that could be linked to Moscow, undermining the basis of a society that existed in cultural and civilizational unity with the Russian Federation for centuries.  It has also discriminated and violated its international and constitutional commitments, he added.\\n\\nFollowing the 2019 election, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy armed his country with Western aid, prepared for war with the Russian Federation and called on all residents who considered themselves Russians to leave his country, he continued.  Those who did not \\u2014 namely the residents of the Donbas \\u2014 were then bombed, shelled and destroyed, not as a response to the Russian Federation\\u2019s actions, but rather out of the purposeful attempt to destroy Russian language and culture in an egregious violation of the Russian-speaking population\\u2019s rights.  Highlighting several quotes, which, among other things, referred to the Russian people as \\u201crats\\u201d who should be poisoned and destroyed, he stressed that what is happening now in Ukraine \\u2014 from language bans to book burnings \\u2014 is linguistic inquisition and obscurantism for which innocent people are suffering and dying.  Yet, the West did not react to this at all.  No condemnation of Moscow\\u2019s special military operation can explain the extent of Russophobia in those countries, he asserted.  He then directed the Council\\u2019s attention to Kyiv\\u2019s seizure of churches, parishes and monasteries and emphasized that his country convened today\\u2019s meeting to point out the threat of Ukraine\\u2019s Russophobia to international peace and security.  A long-term and sustainable peace in Europe cannot be built on Russophobia, he underscored.\\n\\nJO\\u00c3O GEN\\u00c9SIO DE ALMEIDA FILHO (Brazil) said that, last week, once again, missiles struck various civilian areas of Ukraine.  Deploring that use of violence and renewing his appeal for dialogue and a ceasefire, he said the Security Council\\u2019s attention has so far not produced any results on the ground.  He encouraged a reflection on the current dynamics of the Council\\u2019s meetings \\u2014 and on the role of the Council \\u2014 while pointing out:  \\u201cThe mere repetition of national positions, in a format that shows clear signs of exhaustion, will contribute nothing to the end of the conflict.\\u201d  At the same time, Brazil stands against efforts to isolate the Russian Federation at diplomatic fora and through unilateral sanctions, which are not approved by the Council.  At this point, it would be more productive to discuss pragmatic means to achieve peace, a concept that has been largely absent from the organ\\u2019s debates.  Grievances and security concerns from both sides will have to be addressed.  Turning to the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which is about to expire, he urged the parties to seek a swift renewal and encouraged all Member States to avoid actions that may compromise its implementation.\\n\\nMAGOSAKI KAORU (Japan) noted that various forms of discrimination, harmful rhetoric and incitement related to the war in Ukraine exist.  While that must never be tolerated, it nevertheless remains true that no allegations of discrimination can justify the use of force.  \\u201cIf anything, the unlawful Russian invasion of Ukraine might actually have given rise to harmful rhetoric and incitement towards those who align themselves with the unjustifiable aggression,\\u201d he stressed.  In line with the resolutions of the General Assembly, he reiterated the demand for Moscow\\u2019s immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders, and for a cessation of all hostilities.\\n\\nCHRISTOPHE NANGA (Gabon) voiced his deep concern that \\u201cthere is nothing positive on the horizon\\u201d with respect to the conflict in Ukraine and its impact on entire generations of people.  Calling on the parties to show restraint and refrain from incitement to hatred, he said such actions will only push a political solution and lasting peace further away.  The parties should take action to fight hate speech and abide by the provision of the Charter of the United Nations, which prohibit discriminatory language based on any forms of identity.  He joined other speakers in appealing to the parties to come to the table and urgently agree on a political resolution.\\n\\nMOHAMED ISSA ABUSHAHAB (United Arab Emirates) stressed that the hatred of any group is an exercise in closing the mind that succeeds in stripping away empathy at a time when understanding is most needed.  His country has consistently taken a strong stance against intolerance in all its forms, he noted, emphasizing the collective responsibility of the Council to ensure that respect for others becomes the global norm.  In areas of conflict, the Council has seen intolerance taken to the extreme in that lives are lost, communities destroyed and histories erased.  When the guns are eventually silenced, intolerance and bigotry can hamper post-conflict reconciliation and sustainable peace.  As such, the Council must redouble its efforts to address the proliferation of hate speech and intolerance, including through modern technology.  The Council must also prioritize conflict resolution and ultimately a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine as a lasting peace must be its objective, he insisted.  Welcoming the efforts of all parties towards the extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, he pointed out that its existence shows the promise of constructive dialogue even in the midst of conflict.  \\u201cA worldview that supports xenophobia serves no one,\\u201d he emphasized.\\n\\nFERGUS JOHN ECKERSLEY (United Kingdom) said \\u201cRussophobia\\u201d is just another in Moscow\\u2019s ever-growing list of excuses to justify its war in Ukraine.  \\u201cThe fact that they are inventing so many of these is itself a good indication that they know none of them stands up to full scrutiny,\\u201d he said, declaring:  \\u201cWe are not Russophobes [\\u2026] we do not want Russia to fail as a State, as the Russian delegation sometimes claims.\\u201d  Instead, the United Kingdom desires a Russian Federation that is prosperous and stable \\u2014 \\u201cjust one that does not invade and try to annex its neighbours\\u201d.  Outlining the massive cost of war over the past year, he cited thousands of deaths and widespread reports of atrocities.  To build domestic support for his war, President Vladimir V. Putin\\u2019s Government is pushing out propaganda about Ukraine, aimed at dehumanizing the people it is killing and delegitimizing the country it is invading.  \\u201cAll while falsely claiming that Russia is somehow the victim,\\u201d he said, rejecting false claims that Ukrainians are neo-Nazis, \\u201ccockroaches\\u201d, \\u201cgrunting pigs\\u201d or \\u201cscum and freaks\\u201d, and calling for an end to the killing and propaganda.\\n\\nDIARRA DIME LABILLE (France) pointed out that Russian Federation is once again tying to divert attention by alleging the existence of discrimination so that the Council looks away from the atrocities and abuses Moscow continues to commit in Ukraine.  This strategy is not new, she noted, emphasizing that Moscow has sought to distort reality since the beginning of its war of aggression.  However, this propaganda strategy does not work and Moscow will not succeed in its unjustifiable war by cultivating the myth of so-called Russophobia.  The reality is that the Russian Federation is carrying out illegal and unjustified aggression against a sovereign State, Ukraine, in flagrant violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.  This aggression goes hand in hand with mass violations constituting war crimes and crimes against humanity, she continued before emphasizing that her Government\\u2019s resolve is stronger than ever.  France will stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine for as long as necessary, ensure that justice is done and support the efforts of Ukrainian courts and the International Criminal Court.  She called on the Russian Federation to withdraw its troops from Ukraine and fully respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of that embattled country.\\n\\nMONICA SOLEDAD SANCHEZ IZQUIERDO (Ecuador) rejected all forms of racial discrimination, xenophobia and related forms on intolerance in any context \\u2014 be it during peace or war \\u2014 and regardless of origin.  Rejecting also the corrosive narratives exacerbating the conflict, she pointed out that they are all the more appalling in seeking to justify armed violence.  \\u201cWhat greater act of xenophobia, contempt or dehumanization can there be than war?\\u201d, she asked.  In addition to claiming human lives, destroying civil infrastructure and ruining livelihoods, war affects the full enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedoms, and is a pretext for the violations and abuses of these rights.  She then called on the Russian Federation to withdraw its military forces from Ukraine\\u2019s territory within its internally recognized borders and cease hostilities as demanded by the General Assembly on a comprehensive, just and lasting peace adopted during its eleventh emergency special session on 23 February.\\n\\nARIAN SPASSE (Albania), recalling a June 2022 Council meeting on the topic \\u201cincitement to violence leading to atrocity crimes\\u201d, said that at the time, delegations referenced many historical examples \\u2014 from the genocide in Rwanda to the Holocaust during the Second World War \\u2014 in which massive atrocity crimes were planned and executed, based first on the dehumanization of an entire people.  The same is now happening in Ukraine, he said, noting that calls for \\u201cde-Ukrainization\\u201d are now being followed by atrocity crimes \\u2014 killings, deportation of civilians and the destruction of cultural sites, among others.  However, Ukrainians today are more united than ever, and are heroically defending their country.  \\u201cThe world has been clear in distinguishing the wrong from the right, the perpetrators from the victims,\\u201d he stressed, recalling that the majority of United Nations Member States recently voted in the General Assembly to condemn Moscow\\u2019s aggression in Ukraine.  Moscow\\u2019s self-imposed isolation is not a result of Russophobia, but of the fact that the world is not ready to accept its crimes, invasion and violations of international law, he said.\\n\\nKHALILAH HACKMAN (Ghana) urged all Council members to remain focused on efforts to resolve the aggression against Ukraine and to address the concerns of civilians.  \\u201cWhile we do not underrate the potential for the perceived concerns of \\u2018Russophobia\\u2019 to be an underlying driver for the actions of some parties in the war against Ukraine, our assessments do not lead us to conclude that there is systematic and widespread State action against ethnic Russian-speaking citizens of Ukraine,\\u201d she said.  What lies underneath such accusations is, in fact, the attempt by a larger neighbour to assert \\u2014 through brute force and subterfuge \\u2014 dominance over its smaller neighbour.  Voicing her strong condemnation of all violations of human rights and freedoms, she said such mechanisms such as the Human Rights Council, Council of Europe, International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court provide appropriate channels for redressing such abuses.  She also underscored the need to adhere to the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of another State, noting that the Russian Federation\\u2019s choice of force against Ukraine \\u201cexcessively outweighs any threats it perceives as arising from ethnic-related attacks against Russian speaking people\\u201d.\\n\\nDARREN CAMILLERI (Malta), noting that today\\u2019s meeting is yet another cynical attempt to justify the unjustifiable, reiterated his country\\u2019s strong condemnation of the Russian Federation\\u2019s aggression.  Despite today\\u2019s narratives, which aimed to portray the victim as the aggressor and the aggressor as the victim, the facts are clear for all to see, he asserted as he deplored Moscow\\u2019s dissemination of disinformation and misinformation.  Stressing that there is no alternative to multilateralism and the rules-based international order, he urged all to fully implement the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and other pertinent human rights treaties.  For its part, Moscow must also respect the International Court of Justice\\u2019s April 2017 order on provisional measures concerning the application of that Convention and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.  Regarding the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, he called on the Council to redouble its efforts to ensure accountability for all violations, which must include justice for victims of atrocity crimes and sexual violence, as well as the abductions and forcible deportation of children.  As an important first step, Malta supports establishing a register of damages.  He then reiterated his Government\\u2019s full support for Ukraine and called on Moscow to stop its war.\\n\\nANDREA BARBARA BAUMANN-BRESOLIN (Switzerland), noting that the \\u201ctruth is the first casualty of war\\u201d, stressed the importance of avoiding propaganda, hate speech and divisive language.  The misinformation and propaganda that accompany the war against Ukraine reinforce mistrust, deepen divisions and increase hostility, she added.  Opposing all attempts to justify the Russian Federation\\u2019s military aggression against Ukraine, she insisted Moscow cease all combat operations and withdraw its troops from Ukraine\\u2019s territory without delay.  Noting that information that is fabricated and disseminated to cause harm can never form the basis for frank and constructive dialogue, she urged Council members to refrain from and oppose harmful rhetoric.\\n\\nGENG SHUANG (China), reiterating his Government\\u2019s willingness to play a constructive role, urged the international community to support the peaceful settlement of the conflict.  To stop wars, the international community must eliminate estrangement, prejudice and hatred and sow the seeds of peace, solidarity and friendship.  Regrettably, however, phobias have become the logical premise and policy pretext with which certain countries create imaginary enemies, concoct threat theories, pursue containment and suppression and stoke division and confrontation.  As a result, differences are magnified artificially; disagreements are hyped up to the neglect of commonalities; tensions are reinforced and perpetuated and the world is dragged into the quagmire of conflicts and disputes.  Noting that some politicians have contracted Sinophobia, he cautioned against a zero-sum-game mentality, the perpetuation of policies of containment and suppression, and confrontation.  \\u201cThe world has already been thrown into chaos by the Ukrainian crisis \\u2014 do they want to create another one to change the world beyond recognition,\\u201d he asked.  Humanity is wise and capable enough to overcome various phobias and get along through dialogue instead of confrontation and tolerance instead of exclusion, he said, adding that \\u201ctogether, we can build a new type of international relations based on mutual respect, fairness and win-win cooperation\\u201d.\\n\\nJOHN KELLEY (United States) welcomed all serious discussions on the detrimental impacts of hate speech and harmful rhetoric.  However, he expressed regret that today\\u2019s meeting was not harnessed for that purpose.  Referring to the Russian Federation\\u2019s many claims that it is the victim of the current war, he said the term in English for such assertions is \\u201cgaslighting\\u201d.  Over the last year, the world has heard countless excuses for Moscow\\u2019s aggression \\u2014 claims that the Russian Federation is not the aggressor, that it must \\u201cde-Nazify\\u201d the Ukrainian Government and that it must fight drug addicts and Satanists in eastern Ukraine.  However, nothing can obscure one central fact:  \\u201cRussia is not the victim that it claims to be.\\u201d  Urging Moscow to address the real actions committed by its forces on the ground \\u2014 including war crimes, torture of those in detention, deportation of Ukrainian children and the rape of Ukrainian women \\u2014 he said the string of propaganda emanating from Moscow is only intended to mask the true goal, namely erasing Ukraine from the map and subjugating its people.  Against that backdrop, he said, Ukraine\\u2019s self-defence is an appropriate and necessary response to a war of aggression that violates the Charter of the United Nations and has caused unspeakable suffering.\\n\\nDOMINGOS EST\\u00caV\\u00c3O FERNANDES (Mozambique), Council President for March, speaking in his national capacity, reiterated his grave concern over the continued escalation of the conflict in Ukraine and the harmful rhetoric and incitement to violence used by parties to the war.  \\u201cGiven the global visibility of the conflict, the charged rhetoric that has become common amongst the belligerents risks normalizing hatred and incitement in other parts of the globe,\\u201d he warned.  Such language not only creates an atmosphere of fear and distrust, but also adds fuel to an already acrimonious and destructive conflict and makes attempts at finding a negotiated solution difficult, and the prospects for peaceful coexistence more fragile.  Citing calls by the Secretary-General, he warned the parties against using such toxic language and called upon their respective leaders to earnestly commit to peaceful solutions in line with tenets of the Charter of the United Nations.\\n\\nMr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), taking the floor a second time, said that some Council members have energetically and unconvincingly attempted to bring examples of hateful statements.  The quotes and citations advanced in the Council do not work because it was the Ukrainian authorities and not the Ukrainian people that are the issue, he pointed out.  \\u201cWhere did you hear at least one call to the de-Ukrainization of Ukraine or to wipe Ukraine off the map?\\u201d, he asked, noting that his Government is concerned for Ukrainians and is wondering what led them to the criminal regime in their country.\\n\\nSERHII DVORNYK (Ukraine), spotlighting the brutal execution of the Ukrainian solider Oleksandr Matsiievskyi for saying \\u201cGlory to Ukraine\\u201d, pointed out that the horrific footage being circulated has reminded all of how hatred kills.  This is a real hatred \\u2014 and not fabricated stories that the Council has been obliged to listen to \\u2014 that has been deliberately fuelled for decades; been directed towards an entire nation; and triggered the breaking of a country\\u2019s sovereignty, war crimes and crimes against humanity.  Noting that he would discuss recent developments on the ground at a later meeting in the week, he voiced his regret \\u2014 but not surprise \\u2014 that the Russian Federation flooded the Council with superfluous requests.  Such a response manifests its weakness and lack of credible arguments, he pointed out, adding that Moscow is prompted by its fear and realization of imminent accountability.  The mass graves in Bucha, Mariupol, Izium and dozens of other places have proven the power of the Russian Federation\\u2019s war propaganda in dehumanizing Ukrainians and removing any moral safeguard from its soldiers\\u2019 mindsets.  Article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prohibits any national hatred and war propaganda that constitute an incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, he emphasized.\\n\\nThe history of the past contains powerful reminders of when one nation \\u2014 poisoned with propaganda and hatred \\u2014 waged a war of elimination against other peoples and nations, he continued.  False claims about the discrimination of Germans were used as a justification for aggressive expansionism, annexations and atrocities.  With so many similarities to the Russian Federation\\u2019s course of action, it is clear that the Kremlin\\u2019s criminal regime should also find itself in the docks after their miliary defeat in Ukraine, he said.  It will be up to the future tribunal to establish accountability for all those responsible for issuing criminal orders, implementing them and whitewashing them for internal and international audiences, he then declared.  That tribunal should also facilitate a process of moral penance and deep reflection where the Russian Federation can contemplate the role of its leaders and army in committing atrocities in Ukraine.  Such a reflection \\u2014 if underpinned with trials, remembrance, education and reparations \\u2014 can notably result in that country\\u2019s return to the family of civilized nations and a commitment to never repeat the horrors of the war against Ukraine, he said.  He called on all Member States to engage actively in ensuring justice for all victims by holding all perpetrators accountable.\\n\\nMr. SNYDER, responding to the Russian Federation request for sources, referred to him to his President\\u2019s website which showcases his speeches denying Ukraine\\u2019s existence on the grounds it was invented by Nazis and by communists and that a Viking baptized himself a thousand years ago.  \\u201cI do not comment on the historical validity of these arguments \\u2014 I simply point out that these are a matter of public record; these are the statements of the President of the Russian Federation,\\u201d he said.  He also referred him to the genocidal remarks of Dmitry Medvedev on his Telegram channel and clarified that he was simply quoting the Russian Federation\\u2019s State television which are significant not only as expressions of the Russian Federation, but also as a mark of genocidal motivation for the Russian population.  Presenters on Russian Federation television themselves have been worried aloud about the possibility of being prosecuted for war crimes.  Regarding questions on the sources of atrocities in Ukraine, he pointed out that the simplest thing to do would be to allow Russian journalists to report freely from Ukraine and for everyone else to visit Ukraine and ask its people about the war.  \\u201cAs a historian of Russia, I look forward to the day when there can be free discussion of Russia\\u2019s fascinating history,\\u201d he said as he referred that country\\u2019s representatives to even more resources.  \\u201cTo claim that a country has no history is genocidal hate speech, and in that sense, and only in that sense, this session has been useful,\\u201d he added.\\n\\nMr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), responding, noted that Mr. Snyder had not responded to his question and instead delivered another briefing.\\n\\nMr. VASILETS, taking the floor a second time, reminded the representative of Ukraine that he, in fact, represents an entire country \\u2014 including many people who are Russian-speaking and have Russian heritage.  Turning to Mr. Snyder, who seems to represent the views of NATO countries, he pointed out that the bloc\\u2019s weapons have caused great suffering and mass destruction in Ukraine.  While Western politicians often come to Bucha and other destroyed cities for photo opportunities, not a single cent in reconstruction funding has yet actually been received, he stressed.\",\n          \"Title: Is Ukraine a 'State?' The tradition of Russian statehood leads us from Staraya Ladoga and Novgorod through Kyiv to Vladimir and Moscow\\n\\nZelensky, in a video message on the occasion of the day of Ukrainian statehood, said: Ukraine \\u201coriginates at least one and a half thousand years ago from the date officially recognized by the UN and UNESCO, when Kyi, Shchek, Khoriv and Lebed founded the capital of Ukraine. She is the only legitimate heiress of Kievan Rus.\\u201d Last year, the same Zelensky said that \\u201ccousin-nephews and very distant relatives [of Russia] do not need to encroach on her inheritance and try to prove their involvement in a thousand-year history.\\u201d\\n\\nDo we have anything on this except information from the president-comedian?\\n\\nThe Russian state, whose first ruler was Rurik, arose in the second half of the 9th century on the lands that now belong to the Leningrad, Novgorod, Pskov regions of the Russian Federation. Initially, Rurik\\u2019s headquarters was located in Staraya Ladoga, this is the first capital of Russia.  Then the rate was transferred to Novgorod.\\n\\nGradually, Rurik and Oleg, who became ruler under his young son Igor, expanded the borders of the state until they reached Kyiv in 882, where they transferred the grand throne. In the 10th-10th centuries, the Old Russian state occupied most of the East European Plain (forest), inhabited mainly by Slavic tribes, which were assigned the ethnonym \\u201cRussians\\u201d, and to a lesser extent \\u2013 Finno-Ugric .\\n\\nNobody called these lands \\u201cKyiv Rus\\u201d. It was simply \\u201cRus\\u201d, and the term \\u201cKyiv\\u201d appeared among pundits in the 19th century to designate that period in the development of the Old Russian state, when its capital was in Kyiv. In the \\u201cnon-Ukrainian\\u201d part of \\u201cKievan\\u201d Rus, such important centers as Novgorod, Pskov, Vladimir, Suzdal, and Smolensk developed. The composition of Kievan Rus (for convenience, we will continue to use this term) included no more than a third of the territory of present-day Ukraine, and this \\u201cfragment\\u201d was no more than a fifth of the entire territory of the Old Russian state.\\n\\n\\nThere is no evidence that these lands played the role of a metropolis in relation to the rest of the Russian territories, and the Slavic tribes of the Polyans, Drevlyans and several smaller ones who inhabited them formed a special community, different from those living to the north of the Vyatichi, Krivichi and others. And there were no tribes called \\u201cUkrainians\\u201d or \\u201cUkrainians\\u201d in sight.\\n\\nVolodymyr the Great and Yaroslav the Wise would have been greatly surprised to know that they were \\u201cUkrainian princes.\\u201d The Baptist of Russia, Vladimir the Great, was born near Pskov, ruled in Novgorod, and only then came to Kyiv. Also, his son Yaroslav received the Rostov principality (with the center in the city of Rostov, Yaroslavl region of the Russian Federation), grew up there under the supervision of a mentor-voivode, reigned, founded the city of Yaroslavl, then moved to the place of the Novgorod prince and from there, like his father, captured Kyiv during another civil strife.\\n\\n\\nBy the middle of the 11th century, these civil strife led to the decline of Kyiv and the surrounding lands, which was facilitated by the frequent raids of nomads and the desolation of the trade route \\u201cfrom the Varangians to the Greeks\\u201d along the Dnieper. Trade moved to the Volga, where Yaroslavl stood, the demand for goods from the northern principalities increased \\u2013 furs, honey, wax, tar, etc. The economic center of the Old Russian state began to move north, to the Vladimir-Suzdal principality.\\n\\nThe population began to leave there from the south. In particular, it is believed that the city of Galich, now the Kostroma region, was then founded by immigrants from Galicia. So let\\u2019s leave the fiction about the Finnish-Ugric, not related to Kievan Rus, the people, the progenitor of the Russians. In the current Russians and not only the inhabitants of Central Russia (from where the Russians later settled in the Volga region, the Urals, Siberia) there is a lot of blood of the inhabitants of ancient Kyiv, Chernigov, Galich.\\n\\nIn political terms, the \\u201cKyiv era\\u201d in Russia ended in 1169, when Prince Andrei Bogolyubsky, having won the right to the Grand Duke\\u2019s throne, transferred it to Vladimir. By the way, Pope Gregory IX in 1231 in his charter called the Grand Duke of Vladimir Yuri Vsevolodovich  Regi Russiae (\\u201cRuler of Russia\\u201d). \\n\\n\\nAnd at the beginning of the 14th century , the Moscow prince Ivan Danilovich (Kalita), the grandson of Alexander Nevsky, received the grand ducal title. The tradition of Russian statehood and the ruling Rurik dynasty in Russia leads us from Staraya Ladoga and Novgorod through Kyiv to Vladimir and Moscow. Subsequently, the Rurikovichs were replaced by the Romanovs by right of kinship on the maternal side with the last of the Rurikovichs, Fyodor Ioannovich.\\n\\nOles Buzina, killed by Ukrainian nationalists, wrote: \\u201cAfter the decline of Kiev, it was Moscow that preserved the ancient Russian cultural traditions to the greatest extent. The outflow from Kyiv and Galich of the population began here. And cultural. The Metropolitan of All Russia moved to Moscow, libraries were moved, and icon painters moved. That is why the epics of the \\u201cKyiv cycle\\u201d about the heroes and Prince Vladimir have been preserved in the north of Russia, but are completely absent on the territory of present-day Ukraine. Therefore, most of the literary monuments of Kievan Rus survived only thanks to scribes from Muscovy, which is so despised by our current nationalists.\\n\\nIn the XIV century, Kiev, the western and southwestern lands of the Russian state were torn away by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which was later absorbed by Poland. Little Russia and White Russia, as these lands began to be called, turned under Poland into an oppressed province. And in the 16th century, the toponym \\u201cUkraine\\u201d appeared, that is, the outskirts: these were the outlying lands of the state, bordering on the Wild Field, which, under the rule of Russia, later became the flourishing New Russia.\\n\\nAt the same time, the Poles introduced the term \\u201cMuscovy\\u201d, which never had an official character. It is easy to see the political background in its appearance, because the lands captured by the Lithuanians, then the Poles continued to be called Russia, and even Ivan III put forward the goal of collecting the \\u201cforefathers\\u2019 lands\\u201d under the hand of the Grand Duke of Moscow, \\u201cGrand Duke and Sovereign of All Russia\\u201d.\\n\\nAttempts by Ukrainian ideologists to monopolize the historical heritage of Kievan Rus are untenable from beginning to end. In Vladimir and Moscow, the direct branch of the rulers of the Russian state continued, while Kyiv ended up under the \\u201cexternal control\\u201d of the Lithuanians, then the Poles. \\n\\nHowever, the whole dispute about \\u201cprimogeniture\\u201d can be considered pointless. There was a single people, there was a powerful state that existed \\u2013 through unrest, invasions and changes in political forms \\u2013 as a single political organism until the end of the twentieth century. And the memory of this must be kept.\\n\\n\\n\",\n          \"Title: Putin affirmed interest of Russia and Belarus in multipolar world and indivisible security\\n\\nRussia and Belarus \\u2013 under the conditions of unprecedented external pressure \\u2013 are closely liaising on the world arena \\u2013 as stated by Russian President Vladimir Putin at today\\u2019s meeting of the Supreme State Council of the Union State in St. Petersburg, BelTA reports\\n\\n\\u201cIt is important that Russia and Belarus \\u2013 under the conditions of unprecedented external pressure \\u2013 are closely liaising on the world stage.

Despite nearly one third of Ukraine\\u2019s population referring to Russian as its native language, the last 20 years have seen a deliberate shrinking of space.  Ukrainian authorities have stopped any study of Russian language, eliminated it from schools, removed books and prohibited those in higher education from speaking it, even in private.  There has also been a mass renaming of cities and streets; the destruction of monuments; and the seizure of churches.  \\u201cWe see an ideology of hatred for everything Russian, hatred of Russians, hatred of anyone who is somehow linked to Russia,\\u201d he underscored.\\n\\nDmitry Vasilets, Deputy Head of the Ukrainian Trade Union of Law Workers, noting that he speaks on behalf of the millions of Russian citizens in Ukraine, added that speaking Russian was prohibited in schools beginning in 2020 and then in movie theatres, public buildings and other locations since 2021.  \\u201cThat is barbarism that has been enshrined in law by [Ukraine President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy,\\u201d he stated, emphasizing that the use of one\\u2019s mother tongue is a human right protected under international law.  Citing various instances of discrimination, including on social media platforms, he declared that \\u201cthe Russian language is gradually being destroyed\\u201d.\\n\\nTimothy Snyder, Professor of History at Yale University, pointed out that the term \\u201cRussophobia\\u201d is an attempt to justify the Russian Federation\\u2019s war crimes in Ukraine.  The harm being done to Russians and Russian Federation culture is primarily due to Moscow\\u2019s own policies and actions, he countered, spotlighting the emigration of creative Russians due to its invasion of Ukraine; destruction of independent Russian journalism; attacks on culture, books, museums and other landmarks; mass killings of Russian speakers and citizens; and Russian Federation State television proclamations.  The claim that Ukrainians are sick with a disease called \\u201cRussophobia\\u201d is simply colonial rhetoric and part of a larger strategy of hate speech, he stressed.\\n\\nAs the floor opened for discussion, the representative of the Russian Federation said that his country convened today\\u2019s meeting to underscore the threat of Ukraine\\u2019s Russophobia to international peace and security.  What is happening now \\u2014 from language bans to book burnings \\u2014 is linguistic inquisition and obscurantism for which innocent people are suffering and dying.  A long-term and sustainable peace in Europe cannot be built on Russophobia, he underlined, emphasizing that no condemnation of Moscow\\u2019s special military operation by the West can explain the Russophobia in those countries.\\n\\nChallenging this assertion, Ukraine\\u2019s representative stressed that the mass graves in Bucha, Mariupol, Izium and other places have demonstrated the power of Moscow\\u2019s war propaganda in dehumanizing Ukrainians.  This is a real hatred that has been deliberately fuelled for decades; directed against Ukraine; and resulted in war crimes, crimes against humanity and the breaking of that country\\u2019s sovereignty.  In that regard, a future tribunal must establish accountability for all those who issued criminal orders and those who implemented and whitewashed them, he insisted.\\n\\nThe representative of Malta, asserting that today\\u2019s meeting is yet another cynical attempt to justify the unjustifiable, deplored Moscow\\u2019s dissemination of disinformation and misinformation.  Despite today\\u2019s narratives which aimed to portray the victim as the aggressor and the aggressor as the victim, the facts are clear for all to see, he said.  Moscow must stop its current war and the Council must redouble its efforts to ensure accountability and justice for victims.\\n\\nBrazil\\u2019s delegate pointed out that \\u201cthe mere repetition of national positions, in a format that shows clear signs of exhaustion, will contribute nothing to the end of the conflict\\u201d.  It would have been more productive to discuss pragmatic means to achieve peace, a concept that has been largely absent from the Council\\u2019s debates, he maintained.\\n\\nMozambique\\u2019s representative, Council President for March, speaking in his national capacity, warned parties against using toxic language.  Such language creates an atmosphere of fear and distrust; adds fuel to an already acrimonious and destructive conflict; and makes the prospect for peace all the more fragile.  \\u201cGiven the global visibility of the conflict, the charged rhetoric that has become common amongst the belligerents risks normalizing hatred and incitement in other parts of the globe,\\u201d he cautioned.\\n\\nIn a similar vein, the representative of the United Arab Emirates stressed that the hatred of any group strips away empathy at a time when understanding is most needed.  When the guns are eventually silenced, such intolerance and bigotry can hamper post-conflict reconciliation and sustainable peace.  Against this backdrop, the Council must redouble its efforts to address the proliferation of hate speech and intolerance as \\u201ca worldview that supports xenophobia serves no one\\u201d.\\n\\nBuilding on this, China\\u2019s delegate called on the international community to eliminate estrangement, prejudice and hatred.  When phobias are used as a policy pretext, countries magnify differences, create imaginary enemies, concoct threat theories and pursue suppression while dragging the world into a quagmire of conflicts and disputes.  Humanity is wise and capable enough to overcome these phobias by engaging in dialogue and tolerance instead of confrontation and exclusion, he said, emphasizing that \\u201ctogether, we can build a new type of international relations based on mutual respect, fairness and win-win cooperation\\u201d.\\n\\nAlso speaking today were representatives of Japan, Gabon, United Kingdom, France, Ecuador, Albania, Ghana, Switzerland and the United States.\\n\\nThe Russian Federation took the floor a second time and again in response to Mr. Snyder.\\n\\nThe meeting began at 10:06 a.m. and ended at 12:15 p.m.\\n\\nBriefings\\n\\nKIRILL VYSHINSKY, Executive Director of Rossiya Segodnya, noting that he was a journalist who worked in various Ukrainian media outlets, was arrested by security forces on a concocted pretext and went to the Russian Federation following his release, defined Russophobia as a demonstration and imposition of hostility against the Russian Federation\\u2019s people, its State and citizens.  This rejection of that civilization\\u2019s status and culture is being doing publicly on media outlets and the Internet in a targeted fashion.  Anyone who feels they are the Russian is having the right to life, dignity and free movement curtailed, he said before detailing several egregious examples of modern Ukrainian Russophobia.  Among other things, there was a misanthropic call on Ukrainian television for Russians to be dealt with by destroying their families and children; a Ukrainian doctor who urged the castration of war prisoners because they are \\u201ccockroaches rather than people\\u201d; and an advertisement where a Russian soldier\\u2019s throat was being cut as the words \\u201cnow we are exacting our bloody revenge on all of you\\u201d were said.\\n\\nThis is being implemented in practice, he stressed, noting that prisoners of war have faced atrocities and civilians have been shot in the Russian-speaking region of the Donbas.  In March, Ukraine announced a draft bill introducing the concept of Rashism.  There is also the forceful expulsion of the Russian people, lies being told against Moscow and open hatred of the Russian Federation and Russians not only in Ukraine, but also in other parts of the world, such as the European Union.  For example, Poland\\u2019s Prime Minister admitted in March 2022 that Russophobia was already the mainstream.\\n\\nRussians are the second most numerous community in Ukraine, numbering in the millions, he pointed out.  Nearly one third of the population \\u2014 over 14 million people \\u2014 refer to the Russian language as a native language.  Those who constantly speak Russian or use Russian are 53 per cent of the population.  Yet, over the last 20 years, there has been a deliberate shrinking of the sphere for the use of that language.  Discrimination against the Russian language is in the media and throughout the country, he asserted.  Ukrainian authorities have stopped any study of that language, eliminated it from schools and said they would remove a large number of books.  While books are not being burned demonstrably like the Nazis did in the 1930s, they are nevertheless being thrown into the trash.  Everyone in higher education cannot speak Russian \\u2014 not even in private \\u2014 and is being supported by Ukraine\\u2019s ombudsman who promised to broaden and introduce this practice to other institutions, he continued.\\n\\nHe then spotlighted other manifestations of Russophobia which included a humanitarian catastrophe resulting from the cessation of freshwater through Crimean channels; the mass renaming of cities and streets; the destruction of a number of monuments; and the attacks and seizures of churches.  \\u201cI could give you many facts about the Russophobia policies of the Ukrainian authorities \\u2014 they reached their peak in 2022 and 2023,\\u201d he said, adding:  \\u201cBut, the conclusion is simple:  recently Ukraine has seen systematic attempts in various areas of education, culture and the economy and everyday life.  We see an ideology of hatred for everything Russian, hatred of Russians, hatred of anyone who is somehow linked to Russia.\\u201d\\n\\nDMITRY VASILETS, Deputy Head of the Ukrainian Trade Union of Law Workers, noting that he speaks on behalf of the millions of Russian citizens in Ukraine, said that country\\u2019s Constitution enshrines the right to speak and use different languages, including Russian.  However, the criminal regime of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy represses the use of the Russian language.  Beginning in 2020, speaking Russian was prohibited in Ukrainian schools, and in 2021 and 2022, it began to be prohibited in movie theatres, public buildings and other locations across Ukraine.  Those found speaking Russian were even fined.  \\u201cThat is the barbarism that has been enshrined in law by Zelenskyy,\\u201d he stressed, noting that over 70 per cent of Ukrainians remain in favour of studying the Russian language in schools.  Emphasizing that the use of one\\u2019s mother tongue is a human right protected under international law, he described the situation in Ukraine as a case of \\u201clinguicide\\u201d.\\n\\nUrging the Council\\u2019s members to imagine not being allowed to speak or think in their own native language, he recounted his own experiences of being discriminated against for speaking Russian in Ukraine.  Today, against the backdrop of the war and great humanitarian need, even humanitarian aid is being withheld from those who need it, if those seeking it do not address the authorities in Ukrainian.  At least 30 per cent of Ukrainian citizens remain unable to use their own language.  Recalling the adoption of a law that enshrined the Ukrainian language as the country\\u2019s official State language, he said that move impacted other ethnic communities \\u2014 including Hungarians \\u2014 but hit Russian-speakers hardest.  He also noted that the use of some European languages, such as those spoken in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, is tolerated over the use of others.  Citing various specific instances of discrimination, including on social media platforms, he declared that \\u201cthe Russian language is gradually being destroyed\\u201d in Ukraine, which is totally unacceptable in the twenty-first century.\\n\\nTIMOTHY SNYDER, Professor of History at Yale University, describing himself as a historian of mass atrocities and other crimes, said the term \\u201cRussophobia\\u201d itself clarifies certain things about the war.  First, it shows that the harm being done to Russians and to Russian culture is primarily a matter of Moscow\\u2019s own policies and actions.  Indeed, the term \\u201cRussophobia\\u201d itself is a form of imperial propaganda and an attempt to justify Moscow\\u2019s war crimes in Ukraine.  Noting that he shares concerns over the harm being done to Russians today, he urged the Council to consider which actions over the past year have done the most harm to Russian people and culture.  First, Moscow\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has caused some of the most creative and productive Russians to emigrate away from the country.  Meanwhile, independent Russian journalism has been destroyed, \\u201cso that Russians cannot know the world around them\\u201d.  Citing a general trend towards censorship in the Russian Federation, he said that, in that country, hold a sign that reads \\u201cno to war\\u201d is likely to lead to imprisonment.\\n\\nHe went on to describe attacks on Russian culture through the destruction of books, museums and other cultural landmarks \\u2014 all parts of the Russian Federation\\u2019s own State policy \\u2014 and added that the idea of the \\u201cGreat Motherland War\\u201d has also been perverted by associating it with a war being fought in 2023.  He also drew attention to the mass killing of Russian speakers, and of the Russian Federation\\u2019s citizens, in Ukraine as a result of Moscow\\u2019s own invasion.  Meanwhile, a generation of young Russian fighters \\u2014 those that survive the war \\u2014 will have been involved in war crimes, and find themselves wrapped up in guilt for the rest of their lives.  However, he said, the very worst harm to the Russian people and culture is the State\\u2019s broad normalization of the idea of genocide.  Indeed, Russian State television continues to present Ukrainians as pigs, worms, Satanists and ghouls, and proclaim that Ukrainian children should be drowned.  \\u201cIf we were sincerely concerned about Russians, we would be concerned about what Russian State policy is doing to Russians,\\u201d he stressed.\\n\\nMoreover, he continued, the term \\u201cRussophobia\\u201d is part of a long-standing rhetorical strategy used by an empire when it attacks, claiming that it is, in fact, the victim.  Citing the obvious and massive destruction of Ukraine, he said the setting of a war matters.  The idea that the Russian Federation is the victim \\u2014 even as it carries out a war of atrocity in Ukraine \\u2014 is meant to distract from the experience of the real victims, in the real world.  Against that backdrop, he rejected Moscow\\u2019s assertion that \\u201cour hurt feelings count more than other people\\u2019s lives\\u201d.  The claim that Ukrainians are sick with a disease called \\u201cRussophobia\\u201d is simply a type of colonial rhetoric and part of a larger strategy of hate speech, he said.\\n\\nStatements\\n\\nVASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), requesting Mr. Snyder to provide examples, noted that his fairy tales and attempts at historical engineering shatter against historical facts.  In delivering a brief overview of history, he pointed out that Russophobia has become Ukraine\\u2019s bullwork ideology.  While 17.3 per cent of Ukraine\\u2019s population considered themselves as Russians in the 2001 census and 30 per cent refer to Russian as their native language, that country\\u2019s nationalist Government launched a brutal attack on all things Russian.  Authorities were ready to kill Russian-speaking Ukrainians as demonstrated by the burning of more than 40 Russian-speaking activists in Odessa in May 2014 and the quotes of several figures \\u2014 such as Dmitry Yarosh, the leader of the extremist Right Sector organization \\u2014 in the days following the coup d\\u2019\\u00e9tat of that year.  Ukraine\\u2019s attempt to repeal a law on its language policy notably provoked Crimea\\u2019s separation and protests among Donbas\\u2019 inhabitants.  For nine years, Ukrainian authorities have systematically destroyed everything that could be linked to Moscow, undermining the basis of a society that existed in cultural and civilizational unity with the Russian Federation for centuries.  It has also discriminated and violated its international and constitutional commitments, he added.\\n\\nFollowing the 2019 election, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy armed his country with Western aid, prepared for war with the Russian Federation and called on all residents who considered themselves Russians to leave his country, he continued.  Those who did not \\u2014 namely the residents of the Donbas \\u2014 were then bombed, shelled and destroyed, not as a response to the Russian Federation\\u2019s actions, but rather out of the purposeful attempt to destroy Russian language and culture in an egregious violation of the Russian-speaking population\\u2019s rights.  Highlighting several quotes, which, among other things, referred to the Russian people as \\u201crats\\u201d who should be poisoned and destroyed, he stressed that what is happening now in Ukraine \\u2014 from language bans to book burnings \\u2014 is linguistic inquisition and obscurantism for which innocent people are suffering and dying.  Yet, the West did not react to this at all.  No condemnation of Moscow\\u2019s special military operation can explain the extent of Russophobia in those countries, he asserted.  He then directed the Council\\u2019s attention to Kyiv\\u2019s seizure of churches, parishes and monasteries and emphasized that his country convened today\\u2019s meeting to point out the threat of Ukraine\\u2019s Russophobia to international peace and security.  A long-term and sustainable peace in Europe cannot be built on Russophobia, he underscored.\\n\\nJO\\u00c3O GEN\\u00c9SIO DE ALMEIDA FILHO (Brazil) said that, last week, once again, missiles struck various civilian areas of Ukraine.  Deploring that use of violence and renewing his appeal for dialogue and a ceasefire, he said the Security Council\\u2019s attention has so far not produced any results on the ground.  He encouraged a reflection on the current dynamics of the Council\\u2019s meetings \\u2014 and on the role of the Council \\u2014 while pointing out:  \\u201cThe mere repetition of national positions, in a format that shows clear signs of exhaustion, will contribute nothing to the end of the conflict.\\u201d  At the same time, Brazil stands against efforts to isolate the Russian Federation at diplomatic fora and through unilateral sanctions, which are not approved by the Council.  At this point, it would be more productive to discuss pragmatic means to achieve peace, a concept that has been largely absent from the organ\\u2019s debates.  Grievances and security concerns from both sides will have to be addressed.  Turning to the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which is about to expire, he urged the parties to seek a swift renewal and encouraged all Member States to avoid actions that may compromise its implementation.\\n\\nMAGOSAKI KAORU (Japan) noted that various forms of discrimination, harmful rhetoric and incitement related to the war in Ukraine exist.  While that must never be tolerated, it nevertheless remains true that no allegations of discrimination can justify the use of force.  \\u201cIf anything, the unlawful Russian invasion of Ukraine might actually have given rise to harmful rhetoric and incitement towards those who align themselves with the unjustifiable aggression,\\u201d he stressed.  In line with the resolutions of the General Assembly, he reiterated the demand for Moscow\\u2019s immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders, and for a cessation of all hostilities.\\n\\nCHRISTOPHE NANGA (Gabon) voiced his deep concern that \\u201cthere is nothing positive on the horizon\\u201d with respect to the conflict in Ukraine and its impact on entire generations of people.  Calling on the parties to show restraint and refrain from incitement to hatred, he said such actions will only push a political solution and lasting peace further away.  The parties should take action to fight hate speech and abide by the provision of the Charter of the United Nations, which prohibit discriminatory language based on any forms of identity.  He joined other speakers in appealing to the parties to come to the table and urgently agree on a political resolution.\\n\\nMOHAMED ISSA ABUSHAHAB (United Arab Emirates) stressed that the hatred of any group is an exercise in closing the mind that succeeds in stripping away empathy at a time when understanding is most needed.  His country has consistently taken a strong stance against intolerance in all its forms, he noted, emphasizing the collective responsibility of the Council to ensure that respect for others becomes the global norm.  In areas of conflict, the Council has seen intolerance taken to the extreme in that lives are lost, communities destroyed and histories erased.  When the guns are eventually silenced, intolerance and bigotry can hamper post-conflict reconciliation and sustainable peace.  As such, the Council must redouble its efforts to address the proliferation of hate speech and intolerance, including through modern technology.  The Council must also prioritize conflict resolution and ultimately a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine as a lasting peace must be its objective, he insisted.  Welcoming the efforts of all parties towards the extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, he pointed out that its existence shows the promise of constructive dialogue even in the midst of conflict.  \\u201cA worldview that supports xenophobia serves no one,\\u201d he emphasized.\\n\\nFERGUS JOHN ECKERSLEY (United Kingdom) said \\u201cRussophobia\\u201d is just another in Moscow\\u2019s ever-growing list of excuses to justify its war in Ukraine.  \\u201cThe fact that they are inventing so many of these is itself a good indication that they know none of them stands up to full scrutiny,\\u201d he said, declaring:  \\u201cWe are not Russophobes [\\u2026] we do not want Russia to fail as a State, as the Russian delegation sometimes claims.\\u201d  Instead, the United Kingdom desires a Russian Federation that is prosperous and stable \\u2014 \\u201cjust one that does not invade and try to annex its neighbours\\u201d.  Outlining the massive cost of war over the past year, he cited thousands of deaths and widespread reports of atrocities.  To build domestic support for his war, President Vladimir V. Putin\\u2019s Government is pushing out propaganda about Ukraine, aimed at dehumanizing the people it is killing and delegitimizing the country it is invading.  \\u201cAll while falsely claiming that Russia is somehow the victim,\\u201d he said, rejecting false claims that Ukrainians are neo-Nazis, \\u201ccockroaches\\u201d, \\u201cgrunting pigs\\u201d or \\u201cscum and freaks\\u201d, and calling for an end to the killing and propaganda.\\n\\nDIARRA DIME LABILLE (France) pointed out that Russian Federation is once again tying to divert attention by alleging the existence of discrimination so that the Council looks away from the atrocities and abuses Moscow continues to commit in Ukraine.  This strategy is not new, she noted, emphasizing that Moscow has sought to distort reality since the beginning of its war of aggression.  However, this propaganda strategy does not work and Moscow will not succeed in its unjustifiable war by cultivating the myth of so-called Russophobia.  The reality is that the Russian Federation is carrying out illegal and unjustified aggression against a sovereign State, Ukraine, in flagrant violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.  This aggression goes hand in hand with mass violations constituting war crimes and crimes against humanity, she continued before emphasizing that her Government\\u2019s resolve is stronger than ever.  France will stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine for as long as necessary, ensure that justice is done and support the efforts of Ukrainian courts and the International Criminal Court.  She called on the Russian Federation to withdraw its troops from Ukraine and fully respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of that embattled country.\\n\\nMONICA SOLEDAD SANCHEZ IZQUIERDO (Ecuador) rejected all forms of racial discrimination, xenophobia and related forms on intolerance in any context \\u2014 be it during peace or war \\u2014 and regardless of origin.  Rejecting also the corrosive narratives exacerbating the conflict, she pointed out that they are all the more appalling in seeking to justify armed violence.  \\u201cWhat greater act of xenophobia, contempt or dehumanization can there be than war?\\u201d, she asked.  In addition to claiming human lives, destroying civil infrastructure and ruining livelihoods, war affects the full enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedoms, and is a pretext for the violations and abuses of these rights.  She then called on the Russian Federation to withdraw its military forces from Ukraine\\u2019s territory within its internally recognized borders and cease hostilities as demanded by the General Assembly on a comprehensive, just and lasting peace adopted during its eleventh emergency special session on 23 February.\\n\\nARIAN SPASSE (Albania), recalling a June 2022 Council meeting on the topic \\u201cincitement to violence leading to atrocity crimes\\u201d, said that at the time, delegations referenced many historical examples \\u2014 from the genocide in Rwanda to the Holocaust during the Second World War \\u2014 in which massive atrocity crimes were planned and executed, based first on the dehumanization of an entire people.  The same is now happening in Ukraine, he said, noting that calls for \\u201cde-Ukrainization\\u201d are now being followed by atrocity crimes \\u2014 killings, deportation of civilians and the destruction of cultural sites, among others.  However, Ukrainians today are more united than ever, and are heroically defending their country.  \\u201cThe world has been clear in distinguishing the wrong from the right, the perpetrators from the victims,\\u201d he stressed, recalling that the majority of United Nations Member States recently voted in the General Assembly to condemn Moscow\\u2019s aggression in Ukraine.  Moscow\\u2019s self-imposed isolation is not a result of Russophobia, but of the fact that the world is not ready to accept its crimes, invasion and violations of international law, he said.\\n\\nKHALILAH HACKMAN (Ghana) urged all Council members to remain focused on efforts to resolve the aggression against Ukraine and to address the concerns of civilians.  \\u201cWhile we do not underrate the potential for the perceived concerns of \\u2018Russophobia\\u2019 to be an underlying driver for the actions of some parties in the war against Ukraine, our assessments do not lead us to conclude that there is systematic and widespread State action against ethnic Russian-speaking citizens of Ukraine,\\u201d she said.  What lies underneath such accusations is, in fact, the attempt by a larger neighbour to assert \\u2014 through brute force and subterfuge \\u2014 dominance over its smaller neighbour.  Voicing her strong condemnation of all violations of human rights and freedoms, she said such mechanisms such as the Human Rights Council, Council of Europe, International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court provide appropriate channels for redressing such abuses.  She also underscored the need to adhere to the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of another State, noting that the Russian Federation\\u2019s choice of force against Ukraine \\u201cexcessively outweighs any threats it perceives as arising from ethnic-related attacks against Russian speaking people\\u201d.\\n\\nDARREN CAMILLERI (Malta), noting that today\\u2019s meeting is yet another cynical attempt to justify the unjustifiable, reiterated his country\\u2019s strong condemnation of the Russian Federation\\u2019s aggression.  Despite today\\u2019s narratives, which aimed to portray the victim as the aggressor and the aggressor as the victim, the facts are clear for all to see, he asserted as he deplored Moscow\\u2019s dissemination of disinformation and misinformation.  Stressing that there is no alternative to multilateralism and the rules-based international order, he urged all to fully implement the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and other pertinent human rights treaties.  For its part, Moscow must also respect the International Court of Justice\\u2019s April 2017 order on provisional measures concerning the application of that Convention and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.  Regarding the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, he called on the Council to redouble its efforts to ensure accountability for all violations, which must include justice for victims of atrocity crimes and sexual violence, as well as the abductions and forcible deportation of children.  As an important first step, Malta supports establishing a register of damages.  He then reiterated his Government\\u2019s full support for Ukraine and called on Moscow to stop its war.\\n\\nANDREA BARBARA BAUMANN-BRESOLIN (Switzerland), noting that the \\u201ctruth is the first casualty of war\\u201d, stressed the importance of avoiding propaganda, hate speech and divisive language.  The misinformation and propaganda that accompany the war against Ukraine reinforce mistrust, deepen divisions and increase hostility, she added.  Opposing all attempts to justify the Russian Federation\\u2019s military aggression against Ukraine, she insisted Moscow cease all combat operations and withdraw its troops from Ukraine\\u2019s territory without delay.  Noting that information that is fabricated and disseminated to cause harm can never form the basis for frank and constructive dialogue, she urged Council members to refrain from and oppose harmful rhetoric.\\n\\nGENG SHUANG (China), reiterating his Government\\u2019s willingness to play a constructive role, urged the international community to support the peaceful settlement of the conflict.  To stop wars, the international community must eliminate estrangement, prejudice and hatred and sow the seeds of peace, solidarity and friendship.  Regrettably, however, phobias have become the logical premise and policy pretext with which certain countries create imaginary enemies, concoct threat theories, pursue containment and suppression and stoke division and confrontation.  As a result, differences are magnified artificially; disagreements are hyped up to the neglect of commonalities; tensions are reinforced and perpetuated and the world is dragged into the quagmire of conflicts and disputes.  Noting that some politicians have contracted Sinophobia, he cautioned against a zero-sum-game mentality, the perpetuation of policies of containment and suppression, and confrontation.  \\u201cThe world has already been thrown into chaos by the Ukrainian crisis \\u2014 do they want to create another one to change the world beyond recognition,\\u201d he asked.  Humanity is wise and capable enough to overcome various phobias and get along through dialogue instead of confrontation and tolerance instead of exclusion, he said, adding that \\u201ctogether, we can build a new type of international relations based on mutual respect, fairness and win-win cooperation\\u201d.\\n\\nJOHN KELLEY (United States) welcomed all serious discussions on the detrimental impacts of hate speech and harmful rhetoric.  However, he expressed regret that today\\u2019s meeting was not harnessed for that purpose.  Referring to the Russian Federation\\u2019s many claims that it is the victim of the current war, he said the term in English for such assertions is \\u201cgaslighting\\u201d.  Over the last year, the world has heard countless excuses for Moscow\\u2019s aggression \\u2014 claims that the Russian Federation is not the aggressor, that it must \\u201cde-Nazify\\u201d the Ukrainian Government and that it must fight drug addicts and Satanists in eastern Ukraine.  However, nothing can obscure one central fact:  \\u201cRussia is not the victim that it claims to be.\\u201d  Urging Moscow to address the real actions committed by its forces on the ground \\u2014 including war crimes, torture of those in detention, deportation of Ukrainian children and the rape of Ukrainian women \\u2014 he said the string of propaganda emanating from Moscow is only intended to mask the true goal, namely erasing Ukraine from the map and subjugating its people.  Against that backdrop, he said, Ukraine\\u2019s self-defence is an appropriate and necessary response to a war of aggression that violates the Charter of the United Nations and has caused unspeakable suffering.\\n\\nDOMINGOS EST\\u00caV\\u00c3O FERNANDES (Mozambique), Council President for March, speaking in his national capacity, reiterated his grave concern over the continued escalation of the conflict in Ukraine and the harmful rhetoric and incitement to violence used by parties to the war.  \\u201cGiven the global visibility of the conflict, the charged rhetoric that has become common amongst the belligerents risks normalizing hatred and incitement in other parts of the globe,\\u201d he warned.  Such language not only creates an atmosphere of fear and distrust, but also adds fuel to an already acrimonious and destructive conflict and makes attempts at finding a negotiated solution difficult, and the prospects for peaceful coexistence more fragile.  Citing calls by the Secretary-General, he warned the parties against using such toxic language and called upon their respective leaders to earnestly commit to peaceful solutions in line with tenets of the Charter of the United Nations.\\n\\nMr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), taking the floor a second time, said that some Council members have energetically and unconvincingly attempted to bring examples of hateful statements.  The quotes and citations advanced in the Council do not work because it was the Ukrainian authorities and not the Ukrainian people that are the issue, he pointed out.  \\u201cWhere did you hear at least one call to the de-Ukrainization of Ukraine or to wipe Ukraine off the map?\\u201d, he asked, noting that his Government is concerned for Ukrainians and is wondering what led them to the criminal regime in their country.\\n\\nSERHII DVORNYK (Ukraine), spotlighting the brutal execution of the Ukrainian solider Oleksandr Matsiievskyi for saying \\u201cGlory to Ukraine\\u201d, pointed out that the horrific footage being circulated has reminded all of how hatred kills.  This is a real hatred \\u2014 and not fabricated stories that the Council has been obliged to listen to \\u2014 that has been deliberately fuelled for decades; been directed towards an entire nation; and triggered the breaking of a country\\u2019s sovereignty, war crimes and crimes against humanity.  Noting that he would discuss recent developments on the ground at a later meeting in the week, he voiced his regret \\u2014 but not surprise \\u2014 that the Russian Federation flooded the Council with superfluous requests.  Such a response manifests its weakness and lack of credible arguments, he pointed out, adding that Moscow is prompted by its fear and realization of imminent accountability.  The mass graves in Bucha, Mariupol, Izium and dozens of other places have proven the power of the Russian Federation\\u2019s war propaganda in dehumanizing Ukrainians and removing any moral safeguard from its soldiers\\u2019 mindsets.  Article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prohibits any national hatred and war propaganda that constitute an incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, he emphasized.\\n\\nThe history of the past contains powerful reminders of when one nation \\u2014 poisoned with propaganda and hatred \\u2014 waged a war of elimination against other peoples and nations, he continued.  False claims about the discrimination of Germans were used as a justification for aggressive expansionism, annexations and atrocities.  With so many similarities to the Russian Federation\\u2019s course of action, it is clear that the Kremlin\\u2019s criminal regime should also find itself in the docks after their miliary defeat in Ukraine, he said.  It will be up to the future tribunal to establish accountability for all those responsible for issuing criminal orders, implementing them and whitewashing them for internal and international audiences, he then declared.  That tribunal should also facilitate a process of moral penance and deep reflection where the Russian Federation can contemplate the role of its leaders and army in committing atrocities in Ukraine.  Such a reflection \\u2014 if underpinned with trials, remembrance, education and reparations \\u2014 can notably result in that country\\u2019s return to the family of civilized nations and a commitment to never repeat the horrors of the war against Ukraine, he said.  He called on all Member States to engage actively in ensuring justice for all victims by holding all perpetrators accountable.\\n\\nMr. SNYDER, responding to the Russian Federation request for sources, referred to him to his President\\u2019s website which showcases his speeches denying Ukraine\\u2019s existence on the grounds it was invented by Nazis and by communists and that a Viking baptized himself a thousand years ago.  \\u201cI do not comment on the historical validity of these arguments \\u2014 I simply point out that these are a matter of public record; these are the statements of the President of the Russian Federation,\\u201d he said.  He also referred him to the genocidal remarks of Dmitry Medvedev on his Telegram channel and clarified that he was simply quoting the Russian Federation\\u2019s State television which are significant not only as expressions of the Russian Federation, but also as a mark of genocidal motivation for the Russian population.  Presenters on Russian Federation television themselves have been worried aloud about the possibility of being prosecuted for war crimes.  Regarding questions on the sources of atrocities in Ukraine, he pointed out that the simplest thing to do would be to allow Russian journalists to report freely from Ukraine and for everyone else to visit Ukraine and ask its people about the war.  \\u201cAs a historian of Russia, I look forward to the day when there can be free discussion of Russia\\u2019s fascinating history,\\u201d he said as he referred that country\\u2019s representatives to even more resources.  \\u201cTo claim that a country has no history is genocidal hate speech, and in that sense, and only in that sense, this session has been useful,\\u201d he added.\\n\\nMr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), responding, noted that Mr. Snyder had not responded to his question and instead delivered another briefing.\\n\\nMr. VASILETS, taking the floor a second time, reminded the representative of Ukraine that he, in fact, represents an entire country \\u2014 including many people who are Russian-speaking and have Russian heritage.  Turning to Mr. Snyder, who seems to represent the views of NATO countries, he pointed out that the bloc\\u2019s weapons have caused great suffering and mass destruction in Ukraine.  While Western politicians often come to Bucha and other destroyed cities for photo opportunities, not a single cent in reconstruction funding has yet actually been received, he stressed.\",\n          \"Title: Is Ukraine a 'State?' The tradition of Russian statehood leads us from Staraya Ladoga and Novgorod through Kyiv to Vladimir and Moscow\\n\\nZelensky, in a video message on the occasion of the day of Ukrainian statehood, said: Ukraine \\u201coriginates at least one and a half thousand years ago from the date officially recognized by the UN and UNESCO, when Kyi, Shchek, Khoriv and Lebed founded the capital of Ukraine. She is the only legitimate heiress of Kievan Rus.\\u201d Last year, the same Zelensky said that \\u201ccousin-nephews and very distant relatives [of Russia] do not need to encroach on her inheritance and try to prove their involvement in a thousand-year history.\\u201d\\n\\nDo we have anything on this except information from the president-comedian?\\n\\nThe Russian state, whose first ruler was Rurik, arose in the second half of the 9th century on the lands that now belong to the Leningrad, Novgorod, Pskov regions of the Russian Federation. Initially, Rurik\\u2019s headquarters was located in Staraya Ladoga, this is the first capital of Russia.  Then the rate was transferred to Novgorod.\\n\\nGradually, Rurik and Oleg, who became ruler under his young son Igor, expanded the borders of the state until they reached Kyiv in 882, where they transferred the grand throne. In the 10th-10th centuries, the Old Russian state occupied most of the East European Plain (forest), inhabited mainly by Slavic tribes, which were assigned the ethnonym \\u201cRussians\\u201d, and to a lesser extent \\u2013 Finno-Ugric .\\n\\nNobody called these lands \\u201cKyiv Rus\\u201d. It was simply \\u201cRus\\u201d, and the term \\u201cKyiv\\u201d appeared among pundits in the 19th century to designate that period in the development of the Old Russian state, when its capital was in Kyiv. In the \\u201cnon-Ukrainian\\u201d part of \\u201cKievan\\u201d Rus, such important centers as Novgorod, Pskov, Vladimir, Suzdal, and Smolensk developed. The composition of Kievan Rus (for convenience, we will continue to use this term) included no more than a third of the territory of present-day Ukraine, and this \\u201cfragment\\u201d was no more than a fifth of the entire territory of the Old Russian state.\\n\\n\\nThere is no evidence that these lands played the role of a metropolis in relation to the rest of the Russian territories, and the Slavic tribes of the Polyans, Drevlyans and several smaller ones who inhabited them formed a special community, different from those living to the north of the Vyatichi, Krivichi and others. And there were no tribes called \\u201cUkrainians\\u201d or \\u201cUkrainians\\u201d in sight.\\n\\nVolodymyr the Great and Yaroslav the Wise would have been greatly surprised to know that they were \\u201cUkrainian princes.\\u201d The Baptist of Russia, Vladimir the Great, was born near Pskov, ruled in Novgorod, and only then came to Kyiv. Also, his son Yaroslav received the Rostov principality (with the center in the city of Rostov, Yaroslavl region of the Russian Federation), grew up there under the supervision of a mentor-voivode, reigned, founded the city of Yaroslavl, then moved to the place of the Novgorod prince and from there, like his father, captured Kyiv during another civil strife.\\n\\n\\nBy the middle of the 11th century, these civil strife led to the decline of Kyiv and the surrounding lands, which was facilitated by the frequent raids of nomads and the desolation of the trade route \\u201cfrom the Varangians to the Greeks\\u201d along the Dnieper. Trade moved to the Volga, where Yaroslavl stood, the demand for goods from the northern principalities increased \\u2013 furs, honey, wax, tar, etc. The economic center of the Old Russian state began to move north, to the Vladimir-Suzdal principality.\\n\\nThe population began to leave there from the south. In particular, it is believed that the city of Galich, now the Kostroma region, was then founded by immigrants from Galicia. So let\\u2019s leave the fiction about the Finnish-Ugric, not related to Kievan Rus, the people, the progenitor of the Russians. In the current Russians and not only the inhabitants of Central Russia (from where the Russians later settled in the Volga region, the Urals, Siberia) there is a lot of blood of the inhabitants of ancient Kyiv, Chernigov, Galich.\\n\\nIn political terms, the \\u201cKyiv era\\u201d in Russia ended in 1169, when Prince Andrei Bogolyubsky, having won the right to the Grand Duke\\u2019s throne, transferred it to Vladimir. By the way, Pope Gregory IX in 1231 in his charter called the Grand Duke of Vladimir Yuri Vsevolodovich  Regi Russiae (\\u201cRuler of Russia\\u201d). \\n\\n\\nAnd at the beginning of the 14th century , the Moscow prince Ivan Danilovich (Kalita), the grandson of Alexander Nevsky, received the grand ducal title. The tradition of Russian statehood and the ruling Rurik dynasty in Russia leads us from Staraya Ladoga and Novgorod through Kyiv to Vladimir and Moscow. Subsequently, the Rurikovichs were replaced by the Romanovs by right of kinship on the maternal side with the last of the Rurikovichs, Fyodor Ioannovich.\\n\\nOles Buzina, killed by Ukrainian nationalists, wrote: \\u201cAfter the decline of Kiev, it was Moscow that preserved the ancient Russian cultural traditions to the greatest extent. The outflow from Kyiv and Galich of the population began here. And cultural. The Metropolitan of All Russia moved to Moscow, libraries were moved, and icon painters moved. That is why the epics of the \\u201cKyiv cycle\\u201d about the heroes and Prince Vladimir have been preserved in the north of Russia, but are completely absent on the territory of present-day Ukraine. Therefore, most of the literary monuments of Kievan Rus survived only thanks to scribes from Muscovy, which is so despised by our current nationalists.\\n\\nIn the XIV century, Kiev, the western and southwestern lands of the Russian state were torn away by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which was later absorbed by Poland. Little Russia and White Russia, as these lands began to be called, turned under Poland into an oppressed province. And in the 16th century, the toponym \\u201cUkraine\\u201d appeared, that is, the outskirts: these were the outlying lands of the state, bordering on the Wild Field, which, under the rule of Russia, later became the flourishing New Russia.\\n\\nAt the same time, the Poles introduced the term \\u201cMuscovy\\u201d, which never had an official character. It is easy to see the political background in its appearance, because the lands captured by the Lithuanians, then the Poles continued to be called Russia, and even Ivan III put forward the goal of collecting the \\u201cforefathers\\u2019 lands\\u201d under the hand of the Grand Duke of Moscow, \\u201cGrand Duke and Sovereign of All Russia\\u201d.\\n\\nAttempts by Ukrainian ideologists to monopolize the historical heritage of Kievan Rus are untenable from beginning to end. In Vladimir and Moscow, the direct branch of the rulers of the Russian state continued, while Kyiv ended up under the \\u201cexternal control\\u201d of the Lithuanians, then the Poles. \\n\\nHowever, the whole dispute about \\u201cprimogeniture\\u201d can be considered pointless. There was a single people, there was a powerful state that existed \\u2013 through unrest, invasions and changes in political forms \\u2013 as a single political organism until the end of the twentieth century. And the memory of this must be kept.\\n\\n\\n\",\n          \"Title: Putin affirmed interest of Russia and Belarus in multipolar world and indivisible security\\n\\nRussia and Belarus \\u2013 under the conditions of unprecedented external pressure \\u2013 are closely liaising on the world arena \\u2013 as stated by Russian President Vladimir Putin at today\\u2019s meeting of the Supreme State Council of the Union State in St. Petersburg, BelTA reports\\n\\n\\u201cIt is important that Russia and Belarus \\u2013 under the conditions of unprecedented external pressure \\u2013 are closely liaising on the world stage.

Your goal is to classify the text based on whether it supports, rejects, offers a mixed view, or does not contain the claim at all. Claim:\"+q+\". Text:\"+a+\". Instructions: Read the text carefully and identify any statements that relate to the claim. Determine the overall sentiment of the text towards the claim: - If the text supports the claim, respond with 1. - If the text rejects the claim, respond with 0. - If the text offers a mixed view on the claim, respond with 2. - If the text does not contain the claim at all, respond with 2. If the beginning of the text expresses different stance on the claim than the end or the middle of the text, then respond with 2. Repeat the assessment nine times and choose the response occuring more often. Example Response: If the text contains evidence that contradicts the idea of Russia as a defender of traditional values, such as references to high abortion rates, divorce rates, and the political motivations behind the anti-gay campaign, you would respond with 0. Apply this analytical logic to other claims and texts. Please provide your classification based on the analysis of the text and respond only with a numeric label.\"\n",
