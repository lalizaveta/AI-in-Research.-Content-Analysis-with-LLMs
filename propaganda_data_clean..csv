The anti-gay campaign may have helped the Kremlin to pit the conservative majority against the excessively modernized trouble-makers. But the wave of negative publicity this campaign is generating has taken a heavy toll on the image of Russia in general, and the Sochi Olympics in particular. By Maria Lipman
Published on January 30, 2014.
Twenty seven Nobel Laureates signed a letter demanding that Russia repeal its ban on “propaganda of nontraditional relations among minors.” In Russia, however, it is not uncommon to think that the ban is actually not enough. For instance, the creative director of Russia’s largest mobile phone retailer says he’d burn gays in the furnace alive. In early January he wrote an open letter to President Putin calling for recriminalization of gay sex among men (such a law existed in the Soviet Union and was abolished in post-Communist Russia just over two decades ago). A high-ranking representative of the Russian Orthodox Church says it’s a good idea and suggests that Russia hold a national referendum on the recriminalization of gay sex. A popular TV anchor also said earlier that the infamous ban on “gay propaganda” is too weak a measure against the gay evil. His suggestion: gays “should be prohibited from donating blood or sperm. And their hearts, in the case of a car accident, should be buried, or burned, as unfit for extending anyone’s life.”

In the past year social conservatism and reliance on “traditional values” have become all but an official ideology in Russia. In his annual Address to the Federal Assembly in December President Vladimir Putin spoke about Russia as defending “the values of traditional families, real human life, including religious life” against those nations that “revise their moral values and ethical norms.” Putin’s stance even won him praise from Pat Buchanan who approvingly referred to the Russian president as “one of us.”

In fact Russia’s claim for moral authority, especially as a defender of religious life, sounds false. While the Western secularization may have indeed undermined some of the traditional Christian values, in Bolshevik Russia religion had been abolished, churches were destroyed, and many thousands of priests and bishops executed (of course the clergy were but one out of many social groups that the Communist regime exterminated). Today Putin’s government, however, would rather lash out at the West for immorality and decadence, than condemn the Soviet perpetrators of terror for their heinous crimes.

The current shift toward moral conservatism is apparently driven by political motives. It was a response to the rise of a politically defiant minority that took to the streets in 2011 and 2012 chanting “Russia without Putin.” The Kremlin responded with a general crackdown and a propaganda campaign aimed to discredit its opponents in the eyes of the more conservative and loyal majority.

Russian conservatism shouldn’t be overestimated, however, as applies to sex and family issues. Buchanan would be surprised to know that Russia has the world’s highest rate of abortions. Divorce rate is quite similar to that in the United States (Putin himself divorced just last year). Extra- or premarital sex is hardly shocking to anyone. It is in their perception of gays that the Russian people are radically more conservative than their western counterparts. And that made gays a useful target for the Kremlin.

Ironically it was the ban on “gay-propaganda,” not gay activism that pushed the issue of gay rights to the fore. The gay constituency in Russia had generally kept low profile, and the attitude of the society at large was mostly that of “don’t ask, don’t tell.” Now the infamous law unleashed all kinds of aggressive loyalists and obscurantists and even provoked physical violence against gays. And as the Sochi Olympics drew closer and attracted more attention to Russia, the outrage in the West grew increasingly louder.

The anti-gay campaign may have helped the Kremlin to pit the conservative majority against the excessively modernized trouble-makers. These days those who dare oppose the Kremlin’s conservative laws and policies are readily branded as “unpatriotic” and undermining the Russian “traditional values.” However, the wave of negative publicity this campaign is generating has taken a heavy toll on the image of Russia in general, and the Sochi Olympics in particular. But an even graver damage is done to the national development by the alienation of the younger, independent-minded, energetic, and modernized Russians."

""Russia as a civilization state will continue to uphold the moral foundations of international relations and to promote the principles of honesty, truth, good and justice in international affairs,"" the Russian foreign minister underscored. MOSCOW, November 1. /TASS/. 

An increasing number of people around the world not only sympathize with Russia, but also view it as a defender of enduring traditions and strong values, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at the World Thematic Conference of Russian Compatriots Living Abroad.

""Russia as a civilization state will continue to uphold the moral foundations of international relations and to promote the principles of honesty, truth, good and justice in international affairs. Reliance on the ideals that are shared by the main religions and cultures, respect for the identities of nations and their right to their own development paths are major factors in searching for the best answers to the numerous modern-day challenges and threats. This creative policy enjoys broad support in the international community. A growing number of people, including in Europe, not only have a liking for Russia but also regard it as the defender of enduring traditions and real values,"" the minister said.

Lavrov emphasized that domestic diplomacy, relying on the unique experience accumulated by Russian people from all walks of life living in peaceful harmony, ""will continue to consistently advocate a peaceful, positive and balanced agenda in the interests of promoting conflict resolution and creating a fairer architecture of international relations, which should reflect the diversity and stability of the modern world and ensure the best possible external conditions for the internal development of"" Russia.

The Russian foreign minister drew attention to the fact that Western countries are eroding traditional values and rewriting the basic norms of morality. ""They are aggressively encouraging all-permissiveness, tolerance taken to the point of absurdity and various destructive patterns of behavior. They are adopting bans on religious symbols. The EU pretends not to see blasphemous actions with regard to Muslim relics and the destruction of Orthodoxy, which is no exaggeration,"" Lavrov noted. ""This policy is being conducted contrary to the aspirations of the majority of people, is doing irreparable damage to their moral health, is eroding their civilizational roots and leading to disengagement, depersonalization and the self-destruction of society. The worst effect of this is the growth of radicalism, aggressive nationalism, xenophobia and intolerance,"" the foreign minister added.

Lavrov also pointed out that the ongoing attempts to impose these so-called values which are alien to other peoples by the neo-liberal elite in the West are deeply disturbing."

Russia on Wednesday vowed to defend its ""traditional"" values against threats from the United States and so-called ""gay propaganda"" in a document signed by President Vladimir Putin.

The presidential decree, setting out official policy and entering force immediately, stresses the importance of ""traditional values as the basis of Russian society.""

It warns that Moscow must take ""urgent measures"" to ward off threats including those posed by terrorist groups, ""certain mass media"" and ""the United States and other unfriendly foreign countries.""

It also lists internal threats from ""the activities of certain organizations and people on Russian soil.""

These foes risk implanting ""alien"" ideas in Russian society and causing ""the destruction of the traditional family unit through the propaganda of nontraditional sexual relationships,"" the decree says, using a phrase used by the Kremlin to refer to LGBTQ relationships.

The Orthodox Church welcomed the document as a way to ""preserve our people and protect our children from being defiled,"" senior cleric Fyodor Lukyanov told state-run news agency TASS.

The mission statement comes as Russian lawmakers are pushing through amendments to toughen up a controversial 2013 law banning ""gay propaganda"" to minors, rewriting it to include adults as well.

Rights campaigners say the new amendments mean, in effect, that any public mention of same-sex relationships is being criminalized. 

Putin's new decree also warns that the country's enemies are distorting ""historical truth.""

Mr Putin criticised the West's more liberal attitudes toward gay rights and US attempts at intervention in Syria

President Vladimir Putin has painted a picture of Russia as the world's last bastion against countries bent upon destroying traditional values in his annual state of the nation speech at the Kremlin.

In a ceremony full of pomp and circumstance, Mr Putin made a particularly thinly-veiled attack on the West's more liberal attitudes toward gay rights, saying Russia would defend against “genderless and fruitless so-called tolerance” which he said allows “good and evil” to be equal.

“In many countries today, moral and ethical norms are being reconsidered; national traditions, differences in nation and culture are being erased,” Putin said, speaking in a gilded Kremlin hall packed with hundreds of officials, journalists and other public figures.

“They're now requiring not only the proper acknowledgement of freedom of conscience, political views and private life, but also the mandatory acknowledgement of the equality of good and evil, which are inherently contradictory concepts,” he said.

In contrast, more and more people around the world are supporting Russia's “defence of traditional values,” the president argued. In addition to a recent blasphemy law, Russia passed a controversial law against “gay propaganda” in June - a vague term for behaviour seen to “promote” homosexuality to minors. Activists say the law in essence condones homophobia and violence.

The passing of the law has also cast doubt on the treatment of LGBT spectators and athletes at the forthcoming Winter Olympics in Sochi, where Russian officials have said repeatedly that the “gay propaganda” law will be enforced.

Russian Orthodox spiritual leader Patriarch Kirill sat front and centre in the first row for the speech, which took place on the 20th anniversary of the Russian constitution.

Mr Putin also took a swipe at the United States for its perceived imperialist foreign policy and meddling in Russia's sphere of influence, noting that Russia does “not aspire to be called some kind of superpower.”

“We do not infringe on anyone's interests, we do not force our patronage on anyone, or try to teach anyone how to live,” Mr Putin said, in an apparent reference to criticisms he has made previously against the US.

Mr Putin also said Russia had facilitated “international law, common sense and the logic of peace,” in an apparent reference to his role in averting US intervention in Syria, a deal that resulted in Forbes magazine naming the Russian president the most influential person in the world, ahead of US President Barack Obama.

The latest disagreement between the former Cold War foes has involved restive Ukraine, where the capital has been beset by three weeks of anti-government protests after President Viktor Yanukovich abruptly reversed course on an expected Association Agreement with the European Union. US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland handed out cookies to protesters in Kiev's Independence Square on Wednesday as lawmakers said they would adopt sanctions against Ukraine if violence against protesters escalates.

Meanwhile, Mr Putin met with Yanukovich last week to discuss a deal on trade and economic cooperation that could alleviate financial woes of Ukraine.

“We're not forcing anything on anyone,” Mr Putin said about Russia's Customs Union with Belarus and Kazakhstan and the possibility that Ukraine will join it. Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov also admitted on Thursday that Moscow had acted “harshly” but within the law in forcing Ukraine to choose between East and West.

In his speech, Mr Putin notably did not mention the amnesty legislation that he introduced to the parliament on the occasion of the constitutional anniversary, which could pardon thousands of non-violent prisoners including two Pussy Riot members jailed for their “punk prayer” in a Moscow cathedral. Instead, he dwelled extensively on issues of healthcare, education and housing, and said that parts of the constitution need to be changed, especially as regarding municipal governance.

In continuing the theme of Russia-under-siege, Mr Putin blamed internal ethnic strife on an “amoral internationale” made up of “out-of-hand, overbold immigrants from some southern regions, corrupt law enforcement officials who protect ethnic mafias, and so-called Russian nationalists, so-called separatists, ready to turn any tragedy into an excuse for vandalism and bloody rows.”

The statement was an obvious reference to the anti-immigrant rioting that has gripped various Russian cities this year and struck Moscow in October after an Azerbaijani immigrant was accused of killing a Russian man during an argument.

By Digital Forensic Research Lab

As Russia continues its assault on Ukraine, the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab) is keeping a close eye on Russia’s movements across the military, cyber, and information domains. With more than seven years of experience monitoring the situation in Ukraine—as well as Russia’s use of propaganda and disinformation to undermine the United States, NATO, and the European Union—the DFRLab’s global team presents the latest installment of the Russian War Report.

Russia defends “traditional values” as a national security matter, criminalizes LGBTQ “propaganda”
On November 9, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed an executive order enacting “The Fundamentals of State Policy for the Preservation and Strengthening of Traditional Russian Spiritual and Moral Values.”  

The presidential decree states that “Russian traditional values” are the matter of the national security. It defines seventeen principles:  

“Life, dignity, human rights and freedoms, patriotism, civic consciousness, service to the homeland and responsibility for its fate, high moral ideals, strong family, constructive work, prioritization of the spiritual over the material, humanism, mercifulness, fairness, collectivism, mutual assistance and respect, historical memory and continuity of generations, unity of the peoples of Russia.” 
According to the decree, the leading threats to traditional values include “terrorist and extremist organizations, certain mass media and mass communications, activities of the United States and other unfriendly countries, a number of transnational corporations and foreign non-profit organizations, as well as certain organizations and individuals in Russia.” It further notes that the destruction of traditional Russian family with “the propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations” has caused negative ideological and psychological impacts among the Russian populace. The Kremlin plans to counter these “threats” through educational reform, as well as working with youth and media outlets, among other measures. 

According to Russian publicist Boris Yakemenko, the Russian constitution does not include an article on official state ideology, so the latest presidential decree is likely a first step towards “formation of the country’s ideology.” 

The decree comes in the wake of Russian lawmakers unanimously passing a legislative amendment regarding “the prohibition of propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations.” A previous version of the anti-LGBTQ law banned the spread of “gay propaganda” to minors; the amendment expands the prohibition to all age groups. The restriction applies to advertisements, movies, and other media. People found guilty of violating the ban face a fine of 400,000 rubles (USD $6,600) while legal entities could be penalized upwards of five million rubles (USD $82,000). 

Russia has already targeted individuals and entities for “propagating non-traditional sexual values.” Some of the latest instances include opening three cases against TikTok, as well as investigating controversial Russian TV personality Ksenia Sobchak.  

Over the summer, Russia revealed plans to construct an online surveillance system that could hunt down “homosexual propaganda,” among other “prohibited data.” In addition, Runiversalis – the Russian analog of the internet encyclopedia Wikipedia – announced that it will not allow “homosexual propaganda” on its platform.  

Russia has long attempted to justify its efforts to defend Russian “traditional values” against Western values, employing the narrative to justify and whitewash its invasion of Ukraine.

At the Russian House in Buenos Aires, as part of the “Russia in a Multipolar World” series, a conference “The Malvinas Question in the Context of 21st Century Colonialism” was held with the participation of leading Argentine experts who condemned Anglo-Saxon imperialism, which, according to them, is behind the majority of armed conflicts in the world.

They underlined that of the 17 territories on the planet that remain deprived of sovereignty, 10 belong to Great Britain. According to them, the armed conflict involving the Malvinas Islands, rightfully belonging to Argentina, was provoked by Great Britain and essentially became the “first war for Antarctica.” They stressed that the British military base in the Malvinas Islands poses a direct threat to the security of Argentina and South America.

Experts noted that at the time the West made every effort to convince the rest of the world that Argentina was an aggressor in an armed conflict with Great Britain and is now doing the same with Russia, which is trying to put an end to the war unleashed in Ukraine by the West itself against the people of Donbass.

They emphasized that the USSR provided assistance to Argentina in the conflict with Great Britain in 1982 with information from satellites, and also recalled that it was the Soviet fishing trawler Belokamensk that was the first to come to the aid of Argentine sailors from the cruiser General Belgrano, which was torpedoed by a British submarine. 323 people died that day, which is about half of all Argentine casualties in the war with Great Britain."

For more than a decade, people have been saying that the era of US dominance is coming to an end. But in reality there are still no other global players to rival it
By Tom Stevenson

In recent years, the idea that the United States is an empire in decline has gained considerable support, some of it from quarters that until very recently would have denied it was ever an empire at all. The New York Times, for instance, has run columns that describe a “remarkably benign” American empire that is “in retreat”, or even at risk of decline and fall.

Yet the shadow American power still casts over the rest of the world is unmistakable. The US has military superiority over all other countries, control of the world’s oceans via critical sea lanes, garrisons on every continent, a network of alliances that covers much of the industrial world, the ability to render individuals to secret prisons in countries from Cuba to Thailand, preponderant influence over the global financial system, about 30% of the world’s wealth and a continental economy not dependent on international trade.

US Presidential Inauguration, Washington DC, USA - 20 Jan 2021

To call this an empire is, if anything, to understate its range. Within the American security establishment, what it amounted to was never in doubt. US power was to be exercised around the world using the “conduits of national power”: economic centrality, military scale, sole possession of a global navy, nuclear superiority and global surveillance architecture that makes use of the dominant American share of the Earth’s orbital infrastructure.

If proponents of the end of the US global order do not assert a decrease in the potency of the instruments of American power, that is because there has been no such decrease. The share of global transactions conducted in dollars has been increasing, not declining. No other state can affect political outcomes in other countries the way the US still does. The reach of the contemporary US is so great that it tends to blend into the background of daily events. In January 2019, the US demanded that Germany ban the Iranian airline Mahan Air from landing on its territory. In September 2020, it sanctioned the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court for refusing to drop investigations into American citizens. In February 2022, at US request, Japan agreed to redirect liquefied fossil gas, which is critical to Japanese industry, to Europe in the event of a conflict with Russia over Ukraine. At the height of that conflict, the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, found the time to visit Algiers to negotiate the reopening of a gas pipeline to Spain via Morocco. These were all quotidian events, unremarkable daily instances of humdrum imperial activity. The practical operation of the empire remains poorly understood, not despite its ubiquity, but because of it.

From this perspective, the menial adherence of Britain to the US global project is at least intelligible. Historically, American planners divided their approach to the rest of the world by region. In western Europe and Japan, American interests were usually pursued by cautious political management. In Latin America and the Middle East, constant interventions, coups and invasions were needed. In east Asia and south-east Asia there was military exertion at scale. As long as it lasted, the Soviet Union was cordoned off and contained, against the wishes of the generals in the US Strategic Air Command, who would have preferred to destroy it in a nuclear holocaust. The major US allies were on the right side of this calculus and had less reason to begrudge it.

When dealing with the US, elites in countries on the periphery of the global economy still often behave as though they are dealing with the imperial centre. The US permits a variety of political systems in its subordinates. US client states include medieval monarchies in the Arab Gulf, military juntas like Abdel Fatah al-Sisi’s Egypt, personal presidential autocracies in the Philippines and Thailand, apartheid parliamentary systems like Israel and reasonably democratic systems with greater social equity and conditions than the US itself. What is required is not democracy, but reasonably close allegiance to American foreign policy goals.
To its credit, the contemporary US foreign policy establishment has shown some candour about its world-ordering ambitions. Much of the discussion takes place in public between a nexus of thinktank and academic institutions, such as the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Kennedy School at Harvard, the Wilson Center, the Brookings Institution and the Carnegie Foundation. Respectable pillars of the establishment such as Michael Mandelbaum at Johns Hopkins University (formerly of the CFR) have talked of the US acting as “the world’s government”. By 2011, John Ikenberry – the central intellectual figure behind the idea that the US builds and upholds a “liberal international order” – was willing to entertain the idea of “imperial tendencies” in US actions deriving from its overwhelmingly powerful global position. Some discussion has begun about the kinds of imperial activity in which the US should engage. In 2014, Barry Posen, the director of the security studies programme at MIT, began to advocate for US “restraint” in the use of force in global affairs, if only for the ultimate goal of the empire’s reinvigoration. But whatever the merits of these contributions, hegemonists who seek American primacy and neo-cold warriors fixed on the likelihood of a confrontation with China have retained a plurality.

For more than a decade, commentators on international affairs have obsessed over the supposed transition from a unipolar order, in which the US is the sole global superpower, to a multipolar or polycentric world in which the distribution of power is less lopsided. But this is easy to overstate. International affairs scholars have long predicted a return to a balance of power among the great states, as a correction to the enormous imbalance represented by the US since the late cold war, if not since the end of the second world war. One question is why it seems to have taken so long. Stephen Brooks and William Wohlforth, two scholars at Dartmouth College, persuasively argued that the extent of American power had to be reckoned with in a different way: the US had attained power preponderance – a degree of global power so great that its very extent served to disincentivise other states from challenging it.

In Britain’s case, accordance with US foreign policy has been so consistent, over time and between political factions, that one must wonder whether Britain retains an independent foreign policy at all. The stance of Boris Johnson’s government – “stay close to the Americans” – continued uninterrupted through the collapse of the Truss government and the troubled ascent of Rishi Sunak. In Ukraine, the vision was straightforwardly that of Britain as airbase, provider of troops to the Baltic frontier, and advanced anti-tank weapons when needed. As prime minister, Sunak may have discovered the promises made by his two forebears to increase military spending to 2.5% or 3% of GDP were beyond the capacity of the Treasury, but the decision to back away from those pledges was based on finances, not a different political programme. British leaders may talk of a shifting world system, but the subordinate style in British foreign policy persists."

The greater visibility of gay and lesbian military personnel appears to be a catalyst for acceptance in wider society, and opinion polls show attitudes are changing.

KYIV, Ukraine — On a riotous Instagram profile featuring pole-dancing, cross-dressing and fierce makeup, a picture of Ivan Honzyk in high heels and stockings next to an image of him in military uniform has gotten the most likes by far.

The junior sergeant's posts are a bold statement in socially conservative Ukraine, where pride parades were often attacked before the war and swaths of the country are occupied by forces loyal to Russia, one of the world’s most conspicuously homophobic states.

But as more members of the LGTBQ community fight on the front lines, the greater visibility of gay and lesbian military personnel appears to be a catalyst for acceptance in wider society, and opinion polls show attitudes are changing.   

Honzyk, 27, said his uncompromising self-expression, combined with his work in places like Bakhmut — the city in eastern Ukraine that has seen some of the bloodiest battles of the war, while serving as a potent symbol of the country’s defiance — is helping to further the cause of LGBTQ rights in the country faster than any pride marches could.   

“My fellow soldiers are really impressed with what I’ve done in Bakhmut, the massive scale of work that I did there, and after that they just don’t care about who I sleep with,” Honzyk, whose medical unit evacuates wounded soldiers and provides emergency first aid, said in a hip café in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, while on leave from the front line.

Plenty of other gay and lesbian soldiers have also posted photos and videos of themselves online, some sporting unicorn insignia on their uniform, the mythical creature an ironic riposte to the idea that there are no LGBTQ people in the military. 

In the U.S., lesbian, gay and bisexual people were allowed to serve openly in the military only in late 2011. Ukraine’s armed forces did not have rules preventing the LGTBQ community from serving, but homophobia was rife in the ranks, reflecting a more widespread societal attitude.    

But in apparent recognition of their services, Ukrainian lawmakers recently tabled draft legislation that would recognize same-sex relationships and address the lack of inheritance, medical and other rights for the partners of LGTBQ soldiers killed or wounded fighting pro-Moscow forces.     

“The parades and pride events were not enough,” said Honzyk, who has served for four years. “The better way to change attitudes is what we’re doing now. We entered the military and we’re showing that we’re worthy. We’re not hiding somewhere at the back. We’re doing real missions, dangerous missions.”  

LGBTQ ‘propaganda’

Across the border, President Vladimir Putin has maintained that he launched the invasion in February 2022 to protect Russian-speaking people in Ukraine’s east, while attempting to frame what he calls the “special military operation” as a defense of morality against un-Russian liberal values promoted by the West. 

Putin has frequently espoused “traditional values” in his speeches and framed gender-transition surgery and same-sex parenting as morally degenerate Western imports. In December he signed a law expanding Russia’s restrictions on promoting what it calls “gay propaganda,” in effective outlawing any public expression of LGBTQ behavior in Russia. 

Any action considered an attempt to promote homosexuality in public; online; or in films, books or advertising could incur a heavy fine.

Activists like Edward Reese, 37, a nonbinary communications officer with KyivPride, said Russia’s invasion had sharpened Ukraine’s sense of its own distinct identity and caused many of his countrymen to show more empathy toward their LGBTQ compatriots.

“People see that homophobia, transphobia, sexism, racism are Russian values,” he said. “People understand that they don’t want to have anything in common with Russia. So that’s why they start to rethink their own homophobia here in Ukraine.”

Reese said he had a tough upbringing and was sent for so-called conversion therapy by religious parents who followed the Ukrainian branch of the Russian Orthodox Church.

The church has been outspoken against LGBTQ people, and last year its leader, Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, said the “sin” of gay pride parades justified the war in Ukraine.

But his influence and that of his church has plummeted in recent years in Ukraine. In 2019 the Orthodox Church of Ukraine split from its Russian counterpart.

Kyiv has since accused Russian Orthodox priests of spying for Moscow, charges they deny. 

“Ukrainian civil society is trying to kick out the Russian Orthodox Church, and they are the most anti-gay people in Ukraine,” said LGBTQ activist Maksim Mishkin, 40, speaking at KyivPride’s offices.

“Today most religious people in Ukraine are either positive or neutral towards us.”
Somebody to hate

Away from the battlefield, LGBTQ groups in Ukraine and abroad have helped evacuate and house people displaced by the fighting and raise money for the military. 

Mishkin said he had held fundraisers to send care packages to serving personnel, the appreciative soldiers sending back photos of themselves brandishing coffee mugs and other items featuring LGBTQ-affiliated logos.

Such efforts may have contributed to growing acceptance in Ukraine.
A January survey by the U.S.-based National Democratic Institute, a nonprofit, nongovernmental organization that works to increase the effectiveness of democratic institutions in developing countries, found that 58% of Ukrainian respondents agreed that LGBTQ “people should have the same rights as others.”

That contrasts with a 2016 survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology that showed 60.4% of respondents viewed LGBTQ people negatively. Last year a similar poll found that percentage had shrunk to 38.2%.

Ukrainian politician Inna Sovsun hopes to harness the positive momentum to pass a draft bill she introduced in parliament last month recognizing same-sex relationships.

“When a person in uniform says, ‘Look, I have a loved one. If I am killed in action protecting this country, protecting every single one of you, my partner will not be able to make decisions about where to bury me because there is no legal connection between us,’ that is something that society cannot say no to, because they are in uniform and risking their lives every single minute for us,” she said.

The major European states are finally – at long last – making some noises calling for a ceasefire to Israel’s genocide in Gaza. What’s taken them so long?

It’s still pathetically insufficient and falls far short of a full-throated demand on Israel to stop its unbridled slaughter of Palestinians – 20,000 of whom have been killed in more than 70 days of relentless bombardment.

But now Britain, France and Germany are calling for a ceasefire. Well sort of. The British and German foreign ministers David Cameron and Annalena Baerbock wrote a joint article in Britain’s Sunday Times in which they said there needs to be a “sustainable ceasefire” but – bizarrely, they added – not right now.

Their French counterpart Catherine Colonna was a little more forthright. On a visit to Tel Aviv on Sunday, she mustered the conviction to call for an immediate truce.

The slightly stronger French position was presaged by the killing of one of its diplomatic staff in Gaza a few days earlier.

Still, despite the outrage of the killing, the French minister’s words were softly spoken and couched with pandering to Israel’s so-called right to self-defense. Perhaps if the diplomatic staffer who died was a French national instead of being a Palestinian man working for France, then Paris would have been more condemnatory in its response.

Pathetic though the European response is with regard to demanding Israel obey international law and stop massacring civilians, nevertheless the divergence from the U.S. position is notable. Washington is also showing signs of pressure from the international outcry over Israel’s genocide with mealymouthed pleas for “restraint”. However, U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration continues to repudiate all calls for a ceasefire and continues unreservedly arming Israel’s killing machine.

What is going on with the European calculation? After all, only as of last week, the Europeans were not calling for a ceasefire. Britain and Germany abstained from a vote at the United Nations General Assembly demanding a ceasefire. The U.S. voted No along with Israel, while 153 nations voted Yes.

The sudden shift by the Europeans is most likely spurred by their concerns over economic pain.

The closing down of the Red Sea shipping route by the Yemenis in solidarity with the Palestinians is starting to ramp up serious economic costs to global trade. The Yemenis have warned that any ships identified as Israeli-owned or bound will be prevented from passing. But the risk is deterring all shipping.

Yemen straddles the Bab el-Mandeb, the 32-kilometer-wide channel at the southern end of the Red Sea which in effect connects Europe to Asia. All ships passing from Asia to Europe use this route on their way to the Suez Canal in Egypt and thence to the Mediterranean Sea and the European mainland.

Aptly named, Bab el-Mandeb (“the Gate of Tears”) is a classic chokepoint. It controls an estimated 12 per cent of the global shipping trade. And the Yemenis have slammed the gate shut.

As a result of Yemeni military attacks targeting several Israeli ships, over the past week, four major global cargo companies have suspended their vessels using the Red Sea route.

All four shipping companies are European-based. They include the Swiss-registered Mediterranean Shipping Company – the world’s largest – as well as Maersk from Denmark, Hapag-Lloyd of Germany and France’s CMA CGM.

A fifth global giant to suspend its vessels using the Red Sea is Evergreen which is based in Taiwan.

Britain’s oil and gas major BP also announced Monday that it has ordered its tankers to avoid transiting the same route.

All firms are citing the deterioration in security conditions for their decision to halt shipping operations.

With the Bab el-Mandeb closed off, that means cargo vessels have to circumnavigate the continent of Africa by the Cape of Good Hope in the far south. That alternative route entails an additional 6,000 kilometers to shipping routes which means appreciably more transport costs from increased fuel consumption, port stops and supply logistics. The added costs will concatenate to hike consumer inflation and stress Europe’s already fragile economies.

It is the Asian-European trade that is most impacted by the Red Sea closure. China is the European Union’s biggest trading partner. The United States is also massively dependent on China for its imports but unlike the European economies, the U.S. receives its Asian trade from shipping across the Pacific Ocean.

The Yemenis have declared their actions will continue in support of “Palestinian brothers” until the Israeli regime ends its genocide.

Yemen may be the poorest among the Arab nations, but it is playing an ace card. It is squeezing the chokepoint on the Red Sea which is threatening severe damage on the Israeli and European economies.

This would explain why the major European states are suddenly finding a voice to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. The Europeans are finding that their economies are at grave risk from disruption of shipping as a result of the Yemenis closing down the Red Sea. Britain may no longer be part of the EU but it is still heavily reliant on Asian-European trade.

Once again, the Europeans are finding they are paying a heavy price for being vassals of the United States and not having any independent foreign policy.

The U.S.-led proxy war in Ukraine against Russia has rebounded with far more damage on Europe than it has on the Americans. The Europeans have slavishly followed Washington’s aggression against Russia by implementing a raft of economic sanctions and cutting off vital energy trade. Germany’s economy, in particular, has been ravaged by the loss of Russia’s natural gas as fuel for its industries.

Likewise, the Europeans have meekly followed U.S. policy by pandering to Israel and giving Tel Aviv political and diplomatic cover for its genocide in Gaza. And as in the Ukraine-Russia debacle, the Europeans now stand to incur more severe economic repercussions as the Yemenis inflict the pain of increased shipping costs.

As that old war criminal Henry Kissinger is reputed to have quipped: to be an enemy of the United States is dangerous, but to be an ally is fatal."

schools

Mass protests across Europe against marriage equality, reproductive
rights, gender mainstreaming and sexual education have centralised
in the past few years around so-called “gender theory”. This theory is
explained as a new threat to the “traditional family” and “natural mas-
culinity and femininity”, as it allegedly aims at cultural revolution: a
post-binary gender world. Many of these debates (and concrete actions)
are targeted at schools and the educational process. It is believed that
“gender theory” is already being taught in schools, which will have det-
rimental consequences for pupils. Agents of the anti-gender movement
claim that children are being sexualised and brainwashed by “gender
theory”.
Taking this debate as the starting point, we first examine the roots of
the term “gender theory” and point to its nature as an “empty signi-
fier”. We then analyse the types of anti-gender actions across Europe
that interfere with the educational process in public schools. Finally, we
consider the role of parents and their right to intervene (or not) in the
educational process. On the basis of the existing rulings of the European
Court of Human Rights, we argue that the provision that parents are
entitled to educate their children in accordance with their religious and
moral beliefs does not mean that teachers in schools should avoid issues
that might “morally distress” pupils or their parents, as long as schools
avoid indoctrination, and providing the topics (like any other topics) are
conveyed in an objective, critical and pluralistic manner."
https://www.theinteldrop.org/2022/08/17/is-ukraine-a-state/,is ukraine part of russia and not a state?,0,"Title: Is Ukraine a 'State?' The tradition of Russian statehood leads us from Staraya Ladoga and Novgorod through Kyiv to Vladimir and Moscow

Zelensky, in a video message on the occasion of the day of Ukrainian statehood, said: Ukraine “originates at least one and a half thousand years ago from the date officially recognized by the UN and UNESCO, when Kyi, Shchek, Khoriv and Lebed founded the capital of Ukraine. She is the only legitimate heiress of Kievan Rus.” Last year, the same Zelensky said that “cousin-nephews and very distant relatives [of Russia] do not need to encroach on her inheritance and try to prove their involvement in a thousand-year history.”

Do we have anything on this except information from the president-comedian?

The Russian state, whose first ruler was Rurik, arose in the second half of the 9th century on the lands that now belong to the Leningrad, Novgorod, Pskov regions of the Russian Federation. Initially, Rurik’s headquarters was located in Staraya Ladoga, this is the first capital of Russia.  Then the rate was transferred to Novgorod.

Gradually, Rurik and Oleg, who became ruler under his young son Igor, expanded the borders of the state until they reached Kyiv in 882, where they transferred the grand throne. In the 10th-10th centuries, the Old Russian state occupied most of the East European Plain (forest), inhabited mainly by Slavic tribes, which were assigned the ethnonym “Russians”, and to a lesser extent – Finno-Ugric .

Nobody called these lands “Kyiv Rus”. It was simply “Rus”, and the term “Kyiv” appeared among pundits in the 19th century to designate that period in the development of the Old Russian state, when its capital was in Kyiv. In the “non-Ukrainian” part of “Kievan” Rus, such important centers as Novgorod, Pskov, Vladimir, Suzdal, and Smolensk developed. The composition of Kievan Rus (for convenience, we will continue to use this term) included no more than a third of the territory of present-day Ukraine, and this “fragment” was no more than a fifth of the entire territory of the Old Russian state.


There is no evidence that these lands played the role of a metropolis in relation to the rest of the Russian territories, and the Slavic tribes of the Polyans, Drevlyans and several smaller ones who inhabited them formed a special community, different from those living to the north of the Vyatichi, Krivichi and others. And there were no tribes called “Ukrainians” or “Ukrainians” in sight.

Volodymyr the Great and Yaroslav the Wise would have been greatly surprised to know that they were “Ukrainian princes.” The Baptist of Russia, Vladimir the Great, was born near Pskov, ruled in Novgorod, and only then came to Kyiv. Also, his son Yaroslav received the Rostov principality (with the center in the city of Rostov, Yaroslavl region of the Russian Federation), grew up there under the supervision of a mentor-voivode, reigned, founded the city of Yaroslavl, then moved to the place of the Novgorod prince and from there, like his father, captured Kyiv during another civil strife.


By the middle of the 11th century, these civil strife led to the decline of Kyiv and the surrounding lands, which was facilitated by the frequent raids of nomads and the desolation of the trade route “from the Varangians to the Greeks” along the Dnieper. Trade moved to the Volga, where Yaroslavl stood, the demand for goods from the northern principalities increased – furs, honey, wax, tar, etc. The economic center of the Old Russian state began to move north, to the Vladimir-Suzdal principality.

The population began to leave there from the south. In particular, it is believed that the city of Galich, now the Kostroma region, was then founded by immigrants from Galicia. So let’s leave the fiction about the Finnish-Ugric, not related to Kievan Rus, the people, the progenitor of the Russians. In the current Russians and not only the inhabitants of Central Russia (from where the Russians later settled in the Volga region, the Urals, Siberia) there is a lot of blood of the inhabitants of ancient Kyiv, Chernigov, Galich.

In political terms, the “Kyiv era” in Russia ended in 1169, when Prince Andrei Bogolyubsky, having won the right to the Grand Duke’s throne, transferred it to Vladimir. By the way, Pope Gregory IX in 1231 in his charter called the Grand Duke of Vladimir Yuri Vsevolodovich  Regi Russiae (“Ruler of Russia”). 


And at the beginning of the 14th century , the Moscow prince Ivan Danilovich (Kalita), the grandson of Alexander Nevsky, received the grand ducal title. The tradition of Russian statehood and the ruling Rurik dynasty in Russia leads us from Staraya Ladoga and Novgorod through Kyiv to Vladimir and Moscow. Subsequently, the Rurikovichs were replaced by the Romanovs by right of kinship on the maternal side with the last of the Rurikovichs, Fyodor Ioannovich.

Oles Buzina, killed by Ukrainian nationalists, wrote: “After the decline of Kiev, it was Moscow that preserved the ancient Russian cultural traditions to the greatest extent. The outflow from Kyiv and Galich of the population began here. And cultural. The Metropolitan of All Russia moved to Moscow, libraries were moved, and icon painters moved. That is why the epics of the “Kyiv cycle” about the heroes and Prince Vladimir have been preserved in the north of Russia, but are completely absent on the territory of present-day Ukraine. Therefore, most of the literary monuments of Kievan Rus survived only thanks to scribes from Muscovy, which is so despised by our current nationalists.

In the XIV century, Kiev, the western and southwestern lands of the Russian state were torn away by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which was later absorbed by Poland. Little Russia and White Russia, as these lands began to be called, turned under Poland into an oppressed province. And in the 16th century, the toponym “Ukraine” appeared, that is, the outskirts: these were the outlying lands of the state, bordering on the Wild Field, which, under the rule of Russia, later became the flourishing New Russia.

At the same time, the Poles introduced the term “Muscovy”, which never had an official character. It is easy to see the political background in its appearance, because the lands captured by the Lithuanians, then the Poles continued to be called Russia, and even Ivan III put forward the goal of collecting the “forefathers’ lands” under the hand of the Grand Duke of Moscow, “Grand Duke and Sovereign of All Russia”.

Attempts by Ukrainian ideologists to monopolize the historical heritage of Kievan Rus are untenable from beginning to end. In Vladimir and Moscow, the direct branch of the rulers of the Russian state continued, while Kyiv ended up under the “external control” of the Lithuanians, then the Poles. 

However, the whole dispute about “primogeniture” can be considered pointless. There was a single people, there was a powerful state that existed – through unrest, invasions and changes in political forms – as a single political organism until the end of the twentieth century. And the memory of this must be kept.

https://theconversation.com/how-russias-recognition-of-breakaway-parts-of-ukraine-breached-international-law-and-set-the-stage-for-invasion-177623,is ukraine part of russia and not a state?,0,"Title: How Russia’s recognition of breakaway parts of Ukraine breached international law – and set the stage for invasion Before Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, it “recognised” two parts of eastern Ukraine as sovereign states: the so-called people’s republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. That recognition is now central to what both Russia and the West are saying about the invasion.

Why does this kind of state recognition matter so much, and how does it challenge international law?

The international law on statehood

International law has rules about what qualifies as a state – and thus what entities get the many rights that follow from statehood. The rules are a compromise between two approaches.

One approach is hard-headed realism. This says we should acknowledge whoever has control on the ground, even if they are lawbreakers or dictators rather than democrats.

The general rule about statehood is that states must meet requirements of effectiveness. The Montevideo Convention of 1933 lists these: population, territory, government and a “capacity to enter into relations with the other states”.

The last requirement can also be described as independence.

A weekly email with evidence-based analysis from Europe's best scholars

The Donetsk and Luhansk republics have probably never had enough independence to qualify as states. For one thing, Ukraine did not give up disputing the territory. For another thing, they have always depended on Russia rather than being truly independent.

But that is not the only problem with them.

The other approach that shapes the law of statehood is the idealism enshrined in the United Nations Charter. One of the rules in the charter, which became binding international law in 1945, is states must not use military force against other states (except defensively or if the UN Security Council authorises it).

This underpins an exception to the general rule. A territory cannot qualify as a state if it was created by illegal military force. And it appears the creation of these two republics in eastern Ukraine in 2014 – and their continued survival – was made possible by illegal Russian military support.

Illegal recognition

Since the Donetsk and Luhansk republics are not states in international law, the territory remains under Ukraine’s sovereignty. By recognising them, Russia denied this sovereignty in a fundamental way. The international lawyer and judge Hersch Lauterpacht called recognition in this situation “an international delinquency”.

In other words, it is illegal. Many states have pointed this out, including the United States and Australia.

This situation used to happen more often. In 1903, the US recognised part of Colombia as the new state of Panama so that Americans could build a canal there. In 1932, Japan recognised part of northeast China as the new state of Manchukuo, which was a Japanese puppet.

What has changed, since 1945, is the rule in the UN Charter against the use of military force by one state against another. That raises the stakes because illegal state recognition can be used to justify an illegal invasion.

The recognition opens up new arguments for Russia

That is exactly what has happened here. As soon as Russia recognised the Donetsk and Luhansk republics, they invited Russian troops onto “their” territory as “peacekeepers”. But it was still Ukraine’s territory, not theirs. And that made the troops invaders, not peacekeepers.

The value of the recognition to Russia is that the invasion looked a little less brazen.

If the two republics genuinely were sovereign states, it would be within their rights to invite the Russian troops, just as other states are free to host US troops. On that premise, Russia can tell its own people and anyone else who will listen that it acted legally.

Some further arguments are now also open to Russia, again based on the incorrect premise that the two republics are states. The Donetsk and Luhansk republics both claim additional Ukrainian territory that they do not control. Russia can now use these claims as a pretext for invading deeper into Ukraine.

Read more:  Ukraine: what’s really behind Putin’s deployment of 'peacekeeping' troops? Experts explain

We can get insights into what Russia might do from what it has done in the past.

In 2008, Russia recognised two breakaway parts of Georgia as states – Abkhazia and South Ossetia. It still militarily occupies them.

In 2014, Russia recognised a different part of Ukraine – Crimea – as a new state. In this case, Russia went further than military occupation. The so-called republic of Crimea was uncannily short-lived. Within two days, it held a disputed referendum and signed a “treaty” to become part of Russia.

Russia’s challenge to international law

Russia is not the only state to illegally invade another in recent decades. It is not even the only great power. The US invasion of Iraq in 2003 was widely condemned as illegal, too.

One difference may be that Russia is challenging the law in a more sustained, systematic way that makes democratic states fearful. But it is not quite accurate to say Russia wants to return the world to how it was before 1945. It has not repudiated the UN Charter.

On the contrary, at least for the time being, it is cloaking some of its illegal behaviour in language from international law. That was what recognising the two republics was about.

But it wants a world in which, for Russia, the flimsiest cloak of legal language is enough."
https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/ukraine-crisis-sovereignty-and-international-law,is ukraine part of russia and not a state?,0,"Title: The Ukraine crisis: Sovereignty and international law . The Ukraine crisis is raising a few integral questions around our understanding of state sovereignty and the rising “spheres of influence”.

The Ukraine crisis has heightened tensions between the West and Russia, and is perilously close to becoming the largest military conflict in recent years. The source of tension relates to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation’s (NATO) eastward expansion—and Ukraine’s bid to join NATO as a member—a position that Russia has ardently opposed. The US and NATO reject this position, arguing that they support Ukraine’s sovereignty and its right to choose to be part of security alliances. News reports from late 2021 provided evidence that Russia has placed around 130,000 troops on the border of Ukraine, indicating that a threat of invasion looms large. However, on 15 February, the Russian defence ministry announced that some units will return from the border and President Vladimir Putin stressed that Russia “does not want war and would rely on negotiations” to resolve the crisis. As such, there is still hope that a diplomatic solution could be reached between all parties concerned.

Ukraine’s sovereignty
The existence of a separate Ukrainian identity has been spoken about by historians much before the nation-and-state building of Russia. However, since the collapse of the erstwhile Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine has been a sovereign, independent country. By virtue of this, Kiev is entitled to decide its own future—including which treaties it joins, and which organisations it chooses to be a member of. Ukraine, for its part, has been working towards a NATO membership for long. Kiev has had a partnership with NATO since 1992, and in 1997 a Ukraine-NATO Commission was established to provide a forum to discuss security concerns. Becoming a part of NATO has also found expression in Ukraine’s policy goals when it adopted a national security strategy in 2021, which aimed to further develop its partnership with NATO.

As such, Russia’s posturing on the issue appears to be antithetical to Ukraine’s position as a sovereign, independent nation. Moreover, Russia is obligated to refrain from the use or the threat of the use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, as well as the Budapest Memorandum signed in 1994. In the 1994 Memorandum, Moscow pledged “refrain from the threat or use of force” against Ukraine in exchange for the surrender of a massive nuclear stockpile that Ukraine inherited during the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Soon after, Russia, as well as other countries like China and India, became increasingly critical of the R2P concept and aligned themselves with a stricter interpretation of sovereignty.
Sovereignty, territorial integrity, and non-interference in internal affairs of countries have been the foundational principles of the Westphalian system. However, the nature and scope of state sovereignty has been contested over the years. Western nations have espoused the concept of a “contingent sovereignty”, where certain transgressions such as human rights violations and state sponsored terrorism negates a state’s authority. This became evident with the evolution of principles—such as the Responsibility to Protect (R2P)—which seeks to legitimise intervention in case of gross human rights violations.

However, R2P came under increasing criticism after the NATO’s 2011 Libyan intervention, which caused a change in regime in Tripoli—with devastating consequences. The destabilising effects of regime change and humanitarian intervention resulted in the side-lining of R2P, as countries were divided on the ideal balance between sovereignty and human rights protection. Soon after, Russia, as well as other countries like China and India, became increasingly critical of the R2P concept and aligned themselves with a stricter interpretation of sovereignty. For India, and to some extent China, this is shaped by their experience with colonialism and their general predisposition towards principles of sovereignty and non-intervention. In Moscow’s case—as will be explored below—the absolutist interpretation of state sovereignty and its rejection of western interventions arises from its rejection of the ‘contingent sovereignty’ approach.

Is this revisionism?
Russia has historically been a staunch supporter of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and non-interference in the domestic affairs of a country. Moscow has largely adopted a ‘statist’ approach to understanding these principles, where state sovereignty forms the bedrock of the international order. However, such defences have been invoked to resist western interference in authoritarian regimes, and shield them from external scrutiny. Nonetheless, this stands in stark contrast with Moscow’s actions in its neighbourhood, where its foreign policy in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region reflects a hierarchy where Russian interests supersedes those of its neighbours. Moscow’s expansion of control over post-Soviet territories, such its invasion of Georgia in 2008 and its annexation of Crimea in 2014, stands as a testament to this fact.

Russia’s justification for its actions in Crimea have related to self-determination, humanitarian emergency, and self-defence—actions that have been undertaken to protect the Russian-speaking population in Ukraine.
Such a position begs the question as to whether Russia is actively creating a sphere of influence in its ‘near abroad’. A sphere of influence is a “definite region within which a single external power exerts a predominant influence, which limits the independence or freedom of action of states within it.” In the post Second World War period, this relationship was exhibited between the erstwhile Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and between the US and Central America. The influencing power can rely upon the use or the threat of the use of force, or utilise instruments other than this. Russia, for instance, has directly intervened in civil strifes, policed borders, waged wars on ‘humanitarian’ grounds and undertaken less explicit interventionist activities of regional integration, security provision, and development assistance.

Thus, there appears to be a regional diffusion of international legal order that is a revisionist concept of international law, which seeks to validate Russia’s sphere of influence accompanied with the right to intervene within it. This is because Russia has consistently used international legal arguments to justify its actions—and has in turn charged western nations with being revisionist and infringing international legal rules. Russia’s justification for its actions in Crimea have related to self-determination, humanitarian emergency, and self-defence—actions that have been undertaken to protect the Russian-speaking population in Ukraine. However, these justifications do not betray a revisionist international agenda; they are perhaps simply ‘lawtalk’ or an unrestrained merging of law and strategy for realpolitik motivations.

The Ukraine crisis presents grave questions regarding state sovereignty and territorial integrity, and how the emergence of new ‘spheres of influence’ could affect state sovereignty.
For now, Ukraine finds itself in the midst of a tussle between the West and Russia. The Ukraine crisis presents grave questions regarding state sovereignty and territorial integrity, and how the emergence of new ‘spheres of influence’ could affect state sovereignty. Since early 1990s, Russia’s perspective towards its region has been that they were considered lesser than Russia. President Vladimir Putin has time and again reiterated that he needs reliable, legally fixed guarantees, against the expansion of NATO to include Ukraine, and the positioning of offensive weapons there. The placing of troops on the border indicates that an offensive threat could be a possibility, should these demands remain unmet.

Eminent scholar Jeffrey Sachs has proposed a diplomatic solution, stating that Ukraine’s independence could be defended far more effectively by reaching an agreement with Moscow to guarantee Ukraine’s sovereignty, as a non-NATO country. The Ukraine crisis challenges the traditional meaning of state sovereignty, and the coming days will indicate how far major powers are willing to go—to either protect it, or encroach upon it."

Ukraine is again looking warily over its eastern border as Russia threatens its territorial integrity.

In recent weeks, a buildup of Russian troops along the Ukrainian border has rattled Western leaders fearful of an incursion similar to, or perhaps even more wide-ranging than, Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Then, on Dec. 17, 2021, Vladimir Putin demanded that no former Soviet states, such as Ukraine, be added to NATO – the Western alliance that Ukraine has long expressed a desire to join – and that NATO cease all military cooperation in Eastern Europe.

Such rhetoric harks back to the Cold War, when global politics revolved around an ideological struggle between a communist Eastern Bloc and a capitalist West. It also serves Russia’s ideological and political goal of asserting its position as a global power.

As scholars of the politics and culture of Ukraine and Russia, we know that underpinning Putin’s goal is Russia’s historical view of Ukraine as a part of its greater empire, which at one time ranged from present-day Poland to the Russian Far East. Understanding this helps explain Putin’s actions, and how he leans into this view of Ukraine to advance his agenda.

The view from Russia

But for centuries, within the Russian Empire, Ukraine was known as “Malorossiya” or “Little Russia.”

The use of this term strengthened the idea that Ukraine was a junior member of the empire. And it was backed by czarist policies dating from the 18th century that suppressed the use of the Ukrainian language and culture. The intention of these policies was to establish a dominant Russia and later strip Ukraine of an identity as an independent, sovereign nation.

A similar ploy has been used to downplay Ukrainian independence in the 21st century. In 2008 Putin’s then-spokesman, Vladislav Surkov, claimed that “Ukraine is not a state.”

Putin himself recently wrote an article claiming Russians and Ukrainians are “one people – a single whole.” This concept of a single people derives from the history of “Kyivan Rus” – the medieval federation that included parts of modern-day Ukraine and Russia and had as its center present day Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital.

In recent years, commemorations in Russia of Kyivan Rus’ history have increased in prominence and scale.

In 2016, a 52-foot statue of Prince Vladimir of Kyiv, considered a saintly ruler by Ukrainians and Russians alike, was unveiled in Moscow. The statue caused consternation among Ukrainians. Placing a mammoth depiction of Vladimir in the center of Moscow signaled, to some, Russia’s attempt to own Ukraine’s history.

The fact that it came just two years after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the invasion of the eastern Ukrainian Donbass region didn’t help.



Ukraine’s Russian citizens

The Donbass and Crimea are both home to large numbers of ethnic Russians and people who primarily speak Russian.

In the years leading up to Russia’s military actions, Putin and his allies often invoked the concept of the “Russian World” or “Russkiy Mir” – the idea that Russian civilization extends to everywhere that ethnic Russians live.

The ideology also asserts that no matter where Russians are in the world, the Russian state has a right and an obligation to protect and defend them.

Ukraine – both in 2014 and with Putin’s seemingly increasingly belligerent stance now – provides the perfect landscape for this concept. And Russia has allegedly been promoting “Russian World” ideology through the arming of pro-Russian separatists in the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk since 2014.

Viewing Ukraine as a country split between pro-Moscow ethnic Russians and pro-Western Ukrainians, however, is a gross oversimplification.

Ethnic tensions?

Ukraine’s ethnic makeup today – with an especially large minority of Russians living in the east – reflects the country’s absorption into the Soviet Union from 1922.

Ethnic Ukrainians lived across the country before it was incorporated into the Soviet Union. In 1932-33, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin orchestrated a famine that killed some 4 million Ukrainians in the eastern regions. The famine, known as “Holodomor,” made it possible for ethnic Russians to move into the territory of Ukraine.

These new residents drove Stalin’s industrialization campaign. To this day, the Donbass remains the heart of Ukraine’s industrial economy.

When Ukrainians voted for independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, all of its 24 “oblasts,” or regions – including Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea – supported independence. The large minority of ethnic Russians – 17.3% of the population at Ukraine’s last census in 2001 – were included as Ukrainian citizens in an independent state. For the most part, they too voted for independence.

For most of the first two decades after independence, ethnic Russians have lived peacefully with Ukrainians and the country’s other ethnic minorities.

But that changed in 2010 when Viktor Yanukovych, a politician from Donetsk, became Ukraine’s president. Though he did not state outright that he preferred a pro-Russian future for Ukraine, many of his policies marked a move away from the pro-European policies of his predecessors and played into Vladimir Putin’s designs on Ukraine.

Ukraine was on track to sign an association agreement with the European Union in 2013. Instead, Yanukovych decided to join an economic union with Russia. This set off mass protests around the country that resulted in Yanukovych’s being ousted. Putin then annexed Crimea on the pretext of protecting ethnic Russians living on that peninsula.

Meanwhile, pro-Russian separatists took over multiple cities in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the hope that Russia would have a similar interest in protecting Russians in eastern Ukraine.

But ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in Ukraine’s east did not automatically support the separatists or want to be part of Russia. Since 2014, some 1.5 million people have left the Donbass to live in other parts of Ukraine. Meanwhile, at least a million people have left for Russia.

Many of those who remain in the territories occupied by separatists are now being offered a fast track to Russian citizenship. This policy allows Putin to increase pro-Russian sentiment in eastern Ukraine.

Ukraine’s strengthening identity

While Putin claims that ethnic Russians living in Ukraine are part of the Russian World, in reality, ethnicity is not a predictor of political affiliation in Ukraine. In other words, being an ethnic Russian or a Russian speaker does not indicate that one sees oneself as part of the Russian World. Rather, across Ukraine, there has been an increase in sentiment of a strong, unified Ukrainian identity since 1991. Meanwhile, the vast majority of Ukrainians support entrance into NATO.

Most Ukrainians see their future as a sovereign country that is part of Europe. But this directly contradicts Putin’s goals of expanding the Russian World. They are conflicting visions that help explain why Ukraine remains a flashpoint.

We argue that the United States has experienced a decline of economic, political, and military power since the 1970s, and that this decline can be attributed in part to the fragmentation of the American corporate elite. In the mid-twentieth century, this elite – constrained by a highly legitimate state, a relatively powerful labor movement, and an active financial community – adopted a moderate and pragmatic strategy for dealing with the political issues of the day. The “enlightened self-interest” of corporate leaders contributed to a strong economy with a relatively low level of inequality and an expanding middle class. This arrangement broke down in the 1970s, however, as increasing foreign competition and two energy crises led to spiraling inflation and lower profits. In response, the corporate elite waged an aggressive (and ultimately successful) assault on government regulation and organized labor. This success had the paradoxical effect of undermining the elite’s own sources of cohesion, however. Having won the war against government and labor, the group no longer needed to be organized. The marginalization of the commercial banks and the acquisition wave of the 1980s exacerbated the fragmentation of the corporate elite. No longer able to act collectively by the 1990s, the corporate elite was now incapable of addressing issues of business and societal-wide concern. Although increasingly able to gain individual favors from the state, the elite’s collective weakness has contributed to the political gridlock and social decay that plague American society in the twenty-first century.

Russian lawmakers agreed to toughen the country’s discriminatory law against so-called same-sex “propaganda,” moving to ban all Russians from promoting or “praising” homosexual relationships or publicly suggesting that they are “normal.”

Moscow’s lower house of parliament, the State Duma, approved unanimously amendments to strengthen the law against “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations,” making such propaganda illegal among Russians of all ages, according to the parliament’s official website.

The original version of the law adopted in 2013 banned “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations” among minors.

“Our bill is not an act of censorship. We are only saying that propaganda, that is, positive promotion, praise, saying that this is normal, and maybe even better than traditional relations, should be banned,” head of the State Duma’s Information Policy Committee, Alexander Khinshtein, said during the parliament session.

The proposed move still has to pass the upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, and be signed into law by Russian President Vladimir Putin, to take effect.

Under the bill, “propaganda of non-traditional relations” is an offense liable a fine of up to 400,000 rubles ($6,500) for individuals and up to 5 million rubles ($81,400) for legal entities.

Opinion: As winter bites, Putin has a new tactic
Foreigners could face up to 15 days in jail or deportation for breaking the law, according to the parliament’s website.

Putin has repeatedly cracked down on same-sex relationships in an effort to uphold what his regime considers traditional family values.

At a speech in Moscow on Thursday, Putin assailed Western culture and told a crowd: “The West can do whatever they want with gay parades but they shouldn’t dictate the same rules for Russia.”

The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2017 that Russia’s so-called “gay propaganda law” is discriminatory, promotes homophobia and violates the European Convention on Human Rights.

The court found that the law “served no legitimate public interest,” rejecting suggestions that public debate on LGBT issues could influence children to become homosexual, or that it threatened public morals.

“Above all, by adopting such laws the court found that the authorities had reinforced stigma and prejudice and encouraged homophobia, which was incompatible with the values – of equality, pluralism and tolerance – of a democratic society,” the court document said.

Homosexuality was decriminalized in Russia in 1993, but homophobia and discrimination is still rife. It is ranked 46th out of 49 European countries for LGBTQ+ inclusion by watchdog ILGA-Europe."

As Ukraine tries to expel Russian forces from its territory, it's fighting a second war — on corruption — as it seeks to join the European Union and NATO and keep U.S. funds flowing.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Some congressional opponents of more U.S aid for Ukraine point to the country's reputation for corruption. The European Union is also raising concerns as Ukraine seeks EU membership. But Ukrainians say that image is outdated and does not reflect their efforts to improve. Here's Joanna Kakissis in Kyiv.

JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: On the outskirts of Ukraine's capital, there's a sprawling estate that used to belong to a former Ukrainian president. He had a zoo, a multiroom spa, an antique car collection, even his own gas station. Tour guide Anastasiia Lazo shows us a vintage ship docked on the river that served as his private restaurant.

ANASTASIIA LAZO: And inside, there are also, like, decorations, Swarovski chandeliers. There were expensive plates and cups, like Versace.

KAKISSIS: Rumor spread that even the toilets in his mansion were gold-plated.

LAZO: He was crazy about the gilded decorations and all these things because it's this old mentality that gold is something - it will make you the master.

KAKISSIS: The ex-president, Viktor Yanukovych, paid for it all with taxpayer money. When Ukrainians found out, they were enraged. He fled to Russia almost 10 years ago.

LAZO: So that's the door from where he escaped.

KAKISSIS: Ukraine's leaders say they've been fighting corruption and Western perceptions ever since.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

OLHA STEFANISHYNA: I hear this word corruption, corruption, corruption.

KAKISSIS: That's Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine's deputy prime minister for European integration, speaking in Warsaw recently.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

STEFANISHYNA: It's fight against corruption. This is what we do in Ukraine. We fight against corruption.

KAKISSIS: Ukraine's reputation as a corrupt, unreformed country dates to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Newly independent Ukraine saw its state-owned businesses snapped up by organized crime with links to the KGB.

DARIA KALENIUK: Like the gas pipeline, like titanium production, like chemical, agricultural production.

KAKISSIS: Daria Kaleniuk is executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center in Kyiv.

KALENIUK: The strategy of Kremlin was, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, to use oligarchs to control the strategic assets to control Ukraine from inside.

KAKISSIS: And petty corruption at every level of society corroded daily life. Ukrainians had to pay bribes to secure building permits to open businesses to keep police from harassing them. After the ouster of Yanukovych a decade ago, anti-corruption activists pushed for transparency reforms in line with Europe.

SERHIY LESHCHENKO: Ukraine established all institutions which are necessary to fight against corruption.

KAKISSIS: Serhiy Leshchenko is an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office.

LESHCHENKO: There is an anti-corruption bureau, special anti-corruption prosecutor and special anti-corruption court, plus national agency on corruption prevention. All of these institutions were established with very strong support of international community, including American government.

KAKISSIS: And in 2020, Zelenskyy's administration introduced Diia, an app that provides citizens with a digital ID that helps them pay for public services online and avoid bribes.

SLAVA BANIK: It's very simple, convenient for them, and it's, like, easy to get access to public service.

KAKISSIS: Slava Banik helped develop the Diia app.

BANIK: But this is the top of the iceberg. The bigger part of our work is the part when we have to redevelop state systems to make them more transparent, more secure.

KAKISSIS: Ukraine's fight against corruption has actually ramped up since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, a member of Ukraine's parliament who is focused on anti-corruption reforms, explains why.

YAROSLAV YURCHYSHYN: Because perception of society that corruption in a time of war - it's murder.

KAKISSIS: Corruption is equal to murder.

YURCHYSHYN: Yes, yes. Why? Because when you steal some money from budget, in time with this money very necessary for our security and defense, so the consequences of that is killing of our soldiers and civilians by Russia.

KAKISSIS: The U.S. Defense Department's inspector general is establishing a new team in Ukraine to scrutinize military aid to the country. And the Biden administration says it will tie future direct budget aid to Ukraine to anti-corruption efforts.

HOWARD G BUFFETT: And so it has to be dealt with. It has to be dealt with. People have to have confidence that it's being dealt with.

KAKISSIS: That's philanthropist Howard Buffett speaking to NPR during a recent visit to Ukraine. His foundation has donated nearly half a billion dollars to humanitarian efforts here.

BUFFETT: It's going to take billions of dollars to rebuild this country. And the people who care about this country and have the authority to make the decisions about how things happen are going to have to make sure that the corruption is not affecting the money that comes in here. Otherwise, you can't be successful in rebuilding.

KAKISSIS: Zelenskyy is trying to show he has zero tolerance for corruption. He has fired members of his own government over scandals. The head of the Supreme Court has been put on trial for running a bribery scheme. And one of Ukraine's most powerful oligarchs who helped Zelenskyy's rise to fame as a comedian was arrested last month on charges of money laundering and fraud. Leshchenko, the presidential adviser, sees Ukraine fighting more than corruption.

LESHCHENKO: The most difficult part of the issue - how to fight with stereotypes. Ukraine has its own stereotypes in eyes of international audience. And to fight with the stereotypes is very difficult. And this will take maybe decades.

KAKISSIS: The former estate of Yanukovych, the disgraced ex-president, is now a park and museum that's open to the public. A pop-up cafe outside sells refrigerator magnets of his infamous golden toilet, which, it turns out, never existed. Anastasiia Lazo, the tour guide, says that toilet is actually a symbol. It's shorthand for everything that was once wrong with Ukraine.

LAZO: While you are counting your coins, trying to get some food to feed your children, to make up your life, some people live like that using your taxes.

KAKISSIS: She says she hopes Ukrainians never forget that.

There is no singular roadmap for Ukraine’s economic recovery. Rebuilding will require policies that are informed by a deep understanding of the country’s strengths and weaknesses. They should not seek to return to the pre-war status quo.
Ukraine's post-war recovery will be unique. The country faces the devastating consequences of Russian aggression, which add to the existing problems of a formerly socialist developing economy. Overcoming these challenges will require a great deal of time, money and effort.

In the first year since the full-scale invasion on 24 February 2022, the Ukrainian economy lost 30-35% of GDP (see Figure 1). This is the largest drop in economic activity that the country has experienced since independence and it will take years to recover from it.

Even after the war, Ukraine is likely to experience serious labour market shortages caused by the exodus of refugees. The memory of the war will also have a lasting effect on the country's investment appeal.

These problems will require creativity from the country’s leaders. The good news is that Ukraine is capable of recovering.

With the right planning, Ukraine can shift its focus, turning disadvantages into opportunities. Ukrainian policy-makers should emphasise labour productivity growth – and use the aftermath of the war as a chance to modernise the economy and state apparatus, including implementing low-carbon production, improving the energy intensity of the economy, and using advances in information technologies and fintech to improve government services. In other words, the objective is to achieve all the structural changes that other European countries have been going through for years in a short period of time.

What strengths can Ukraine draw on?

Ukraine is a resilient nation. Despite a pre-war image of being a corrupt and institutionally weak country with a serious lack of state capacity, Ukraine has demonstrated its ability to cope with even the most difficult of challenges.

The first months of the war were a real stress test for the state machine and wider society. But it was at this point that one of Ukraine's greatest strengths emerged. Despite the panic and risk that the state may collapse, the Ukrainian government was able to take contrarian but important steps to stabilise the economy.

In the first weeks of the conflict, the government cut taxes substantially, reducing the income tax rate from 18% to 2%, abolishing VAT and customs duties on imports, and removing duties on fuel.

These policies contributed to a fall in budget revenues (in March 2022, the authorities only managed to collect 36.7% of the monthly planned tax) and a growing deficit. But it was steps such as these that helped to ensure food security, to slow down inflation, and to provide Ukrainian companies with a financial cushion for the months of most active fighting, after which most of the temporary measures were lifted.

In March 2022, 79% of businesses in Ukraine were idle or on the brink of shutdown, but by the end of the year, this figure had been reduced to just 32%. Given the scale of the destruction caused by the war, this is a remarkable achievement.

Similarly, Ukraine was able to avoid bureaucratic failure. Most public services have remained accessible to the population, primarily due to the high level of digitalisation that has proved effective since the Covid-19 pandemic. Currently, the Diia portal, through which most public services are provided, has over 100 different documents, procedures and permits that can be accessed remotely.

The number of users of the portal has grown from 14 million before the invasion to 18.6 million today. The fact that more than half of the adult population already uses digital tools will allow the state to implement welfare programmes more effectively in the future, to provide better services, to prevent corruption and, at the same time, to reduce the number of officials.

Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, the government used the Central Bank of Ukraine's identity verification system – which relies on the client registers of all Ukrainian banks (both state and private) – to provide virtually all Ukrainian citizens with a single digital identity document. This was an important initiative as many refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) were unable to pick up their usual documents when they moved.

Further, all services for registration of IDPs, financial assistance and job searches were digitised immediately. This avoided the queues at state agencies and lengthy processing procedures that were observed in the first phases of the armed conflict that took place in 2014-15. For example, through Diia, 1.4 million people have been granted IDP status. This equates to almost half of those forced to leave their homes.

These examples show the flexibility of Ukraine’s state apparatus and its ability to react quickly to crisis situations, often using non-standard and unconventional tools. None of the strategic industries of Ukraine, such as the banking system, logistics, telecoms or public services, have been put out of business. Without such an adaptable state, this might not have been the case.

This experience is likely to reinforce Ukraine’s existing strengths and advantages, such as its geographical location. Located at the crossroads of transport routes from Europe to Asia and from the Scandinavian countries to the Mediterranean region, Ukraine is of strategic importance for international trade.

It has 18 seaports, one of Europe's longest roads, and is home to the 15th longest railway system, which still operates without interruption despite continuous attempts by the Russian military to destroy it.

The war may offer an opportunity for Ukraine to bolster its status through trade partnerships, including with the European Union (EU). Ukraine's candidate status for EU membership, obtained on 23 June 2022, opens up new forms of cooperation.

In particular, Ukraine has access to the benefits of the Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA) – a special EU fund aimed at developing transport infrastructure, protecting the environment, enhancing regional cooperation, improving the quality of human capital and activating economic development mechanisms in pre-accession countries.

Given the importance of these sectors in future reconstruction, the partnership with the EU will be an additional source of funding for rebuilding the country.

What are Ukraine’s weaknesses?

Ukraine experienced the largest recession in its history in 2022, losing nearly a third of its GDP. The country has experienced previous recessionary periods in different ways: in 2014-15, associated with the war and lower commodity prices; and in 2020, because of the pandemic.

In neither case did the rate of economic recovery exceed 4%, ranging between 2.44% and 3.49% of GDP growth. If we assume that in periods of growth, the Ukrainian economy grew by 3% on average, recovery after the war would take 13 years. To avoid being set back by a decade, the country would need to achieve record economic growth. Achieving this will require overcoming a number of challenges.

The first challenge relates to workers, following the large-scale emigration of people from Ukraine. Over eight million Ukrainians were forced to flee to other countries in Europe after the invasion, according to the latest figures from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

Of these, around 4.8 million have been granted temporary protection status, indicating their desire to stay abroad during active hostilities. Although surveys show that 77% of refugees plan to return, their decision to do so is likely to depend on the pace of economic recovery. Even under optimistic scenarios, Ukraine will inevitably face a shortage of personnel (especially skilled workers) once the fighting stops.

Despite record high levels of unemployment (from 10.3% to around 26%, according to the Central Bank of Ukraine), a number of regions are already facing staff shortages. For example, in the western regions of Ukraine, where many companies have been relocated, the labour market had already recovered to 90% of its pre-war level by January 2023 and the search for new employees was becoming more difficult.

If this trend continues, companies in Ukraine will face a choice: not to increase business activity, which would be bad for the pace of economic recovery, or to raise wages, to compete not only with local employers but also with foreign firms. This, in turn, may lead to higher inflation (in the case of active recruitment) and discourage investment by companies because of ever-increasing payrolls.

This problem has already affected some of Ukraine's neighbours, such as Poland, which used Ukrainian migrants to cover a deficit of domestic workers. The policy has kept wages from skyrocketing, providing Polish companies with a cheaper labour force, increasing their profits. Thanks to this compensatory mechanism in both high- and low-skilled sectors, the country has managed to secure additional growth of 0.3-0.9% annually.

Ukraine also has a problem when it comes to financial capital. For years, the small size of the economy has dictated conditions for Ukrainian companies: many have focused on foreign markets, while the state has concentrated primarily on foreign direct investment (FDI). Access to credit has remained low, with Ukrainian companies perceived as too risky by foreign loan markets.

If Ukraine only has access to domestic capital – as has been the case in previous years – reconstruction of war-torn facilities will be slow. The country will also be unlikely to reach the level of business activity necessary to achieve the desired growth rates.

Coping with risks and seizing opportunities: how can Ukraine succeed?

In the current situation, Ukraine risks ending up in a ‘grey zone’ of the global economy. At worst, the economy could be left with shattered infrastructure, significant social problems and bleak prospects following the conflict. The shadow of war, in turn, may be a barrier for investors because of the potential risk of new aggression.

To overcome these risks, as well as the direct economic consequences of war, Ukraine needs to exploit its available opportunities. Current estimates of direct and indirect losses to Ukraine from Russian aggression range from $564 billion to $600 billion.

As of December 2022, the total amount of documented damage to Ukraine’s infrastructure was estimated at $137.8 billion (at replacement cost). These are monstrous figures. But they do offer some hope for the rapid development of the country's economy.

Rebuilding could mean modernising. Most of Ukraine's major enterprises or industries, which have suffered in one way or another from the aggression, have gradually become uncompetitive due to obsolete technology, high energy intensity and a lack of funds for their development.

From this place, economic recovery, provided it is based on a ‘build back better’ approach, could hasten the modernisation of Ukraine – a process that many other countries have been going through for years already.

For example, the Ukrainian steel industry has been hit hard. This includes the loss of two of its biggest factories in Mariupol: Azovstal and Illich Steel. But these firms were already massively behind their European counterparts. Preliminary estimates show that the implementation of ‘best available techniques’ in this industry – which is necessary to adapt to the European market and global environmental standards – would require an investment of $6.6 billion from Ukrainian companies.

All else being equal, it would take 30 years before Ukrainian industry could adopt the technologies that have existed in the EU for 15 years. Rebuilding the steel industry after the war might offer a chance to accelerate this catch-up.

This pattern applies to more than just steel. In general, Ukraine’s modernisation would not only rehabilitate enterprises to meet modern needs – making them more competitive in foreign markets – but could also kick-start the process of the re-industrialisation of Ukraine with a focus on labour productivity growth. The latter factor will be a solution to the problem of human resources, among other things.

What about reparation payments from Russia? As it stands, several countries are considering using frozen Russian assets to cover losses from the aggression. This includes the EU, which has frozen more than $300 billion in assets belonging to the Central Bank of Russia, and a further $30 billion connected to oligarchs with close ties to Vladimir Putin.

A joint framework guaranteeing the efficient use of these funds would not only compensate for Ukraine’s losses, but could also help to restructure the Ukrainian economy after the war.

Post-war, Ukraine has a chance to solve some of the systemic problems that have persisted throughout its 31 years of independence. If it is able to do so, it will emerge from the war not only stronger in security terms, but also more resilient and economically developed. To seize this chance, Ukraine's policy-makers should already be working on the pre-conditions for reconstruction.

First and foremost, they must prepare a new institutional framework. Ukraine can draw on existing successes, particularly the country’s rapid and effective digitisation. This has made bureaucracy more efficient and doing business easier. Digital solutions also greatly reduce corruption, which has always been seen as a major problem.

Second, Ukraine should focus on raising productivity and modernising production as a key driver of economic recovery. This will not only solve the problem of labour shortages, but it will also help to facilitate Ukraine's greater integration into the global economic community."

According to a survey, 33% of Kyiv’s residents have switched from speaking Russian to Ukrainian since Putin’s invasion a year ago. About 46% said they had been speaking Ukrainian for a long time, while 13% remain predominately Russian speakers. Until last year, Kyiv was a bilingual city, where Russian was heard slightly more than Ukrainian.

In January, Ukraine’s leading liberal university, the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, banned the Russian language from its campus. The president of the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences, Serhiy Kvit, told BVS Ukraine, “There will be no punishments for using the Russian language in the academy, despite the ban prescribed in the updated rules of the internal procedure. This is not a question of punishment, but of cultural change. The point is not to punish, but to change our internal corporate culture. No one will eavesdrop on the students, but the internal public opinion will be such that it will contribute to Mohylyanka being a fully Ukrainian-speaking university.”

“We will pay attention to the language issue—we will do social advertising. The academic conference voted unanimously because it considered it a problem. We believe that the Ukrainian language should be heard in our university,” added Kvit.

Prohibition of the Russian language does not extend to the educational process and scientific research, so unique Russian-language scientific sources can be used, as can sources related to the study of modern processes in Russia and its politics.

Rector Kvit, a former education minister, said the decision was taken after internal academic discussion. Eight students and staff members have so far died on the frontline, he said. Their framed photos hang in the corridor next to his office.

The university was founded in 1615, shuttered by the Soviets in the 1920s, and reopened in 1991 after Ukraine’s independence. “The decision isn’t about penalties. It’s about culture within our learning community. Language is a frame for culture,” Kvit said. English will now be added as a working language.

In Russian-occupied areas, Ukrainian has been banned from schools and universities, and Ukrainian teachers have been forced to follow Russian curricula. Ukrainian-language books have been removed from libraries and sometimes burned. Children are now being taught a Kremlin-approved version of history. It asserts Ukraine was never a state or a sovereign nation. According to Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, Russia’s removal of Ukrainian books is part of a wider assault on national heritage. He said 1,500 cultural objects had been destroyed over the past year, with museums deliberately shelled and vandalized and objects looted.          "

The ruling comes into force on 19 April. Local broadcasts in other languages will only be allowed in areas with a significant ethnic-minority population.

If Ukraine wants to survive as an independent nation, it has to protect its language.
Ukraine last year signed a European Union charter which obliges signatories to help preserve minority languages, including in the mass media.

The agreement covers 13 minority languages in Ukraine, including Hungarian, Romanian, Bulgarian, and Hebrew. However, it is Russian that is Ukraine's largest ""minority"" language -- and the one that often provokes controversy.

Some 67 percent of Ukrainian citizens call Ukrainian their mother tongue. But large numbers of Ukrainians -- notably in the east and south of the country -- routinely use the Russian language.

Ukraine's large Russian minority -- roughly 17 percent of the country's 49 million people -- also mainly speak Russian as their primary language.

Ukrainian is the country's only state language. But Russian-speakers have often demanded their language also be given official status.

Russian-speakers complain that since independence, most schools offer courses mainly in Ukrainian and state jobs require proficiency in Ukrainian. Such policies, they say, are discriminatory.

But despite attempts to broaden the popular use of Ukrainian, especially in television and radio, many broadcasters use Russian almost exclusively.

Vitaliy Schevchenko is the deputy head of the National Council on Matters Pertaining to Television and Radio. He says a recent survey indicated how pervasive the Russian language has become in Ukrainian broadcasting: ""When, last fall, we carried out a general survey, we saw that in eight regions -- Crimea-Sevastopol, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Zaporizhya, Don, Luhansk and Mykolaiv -- the proportion of the Ukrainian language used in the broadcasts varied from
14 percent in Crimea to 46 percent in Mykolaiv. Well, you know these patterns are threatening.""

That study prompted the head of the television and radio council, Borys Kholod, to decree that all national broadcasters must use Ukrainian.

Kholod said it was the first time the council had considered the language issue in such detail: ""This question arose for the first time in the 10-year existence of the national council. The issue of the Ukrainian language in society and in our independent country is today a very serious problem, not only for television and radio but for all the mass media, including publishing.""

Kholod says that if Ukraine wants to survive as an independent nation, it has to protect its language.

But many details on the ruling's implementation have yet to be worked out. Schevchenko says there are few resources to dedicate to resolving language issues. There are hopes a new tracking group will help smooth the process: ""The decision was also taken to form a commission to monitor these processes. Because the constitution clearly states what the state language is, but the state does not have an official body to look after the development of that language and ensure that it is routinely used.""

Raul Tchilakhava is one of the people who has been invited to sit on the commission. An ethnic Georgian, he serves as the deputy head of Ukraine's National Committee on Nationality and Immigration.

Tchilakhava says he does not believe Russian-speakers will be hurt by the new ruling, which provides minority groups with the right to broadcast in their native language. Areas of Ukraine with large ethnic-Russian populations will continue to receive Russian-language television and radio programs.

In any case, says Tchilakhava -- who is an accomplished poet in both Georgian and Ukrainian -- it is the Ukrainian language that is in danger, not Russian: ""Even future philologists -- lecturers in Ukrainian language and literature -- prefer to talk amongst themselves in Russian. I'm not even talking about the general situation, say in the sphere of transport or on the streets or various meeting places, where the Russian language absolutely dominates.""

The ruling has already come under criticism. Ukraine's Communist Party, which counts the Russian-speaking regions among its main areas of support, says the decision will, quote, ""instigate hostility between peoples living in our state.""

A number of private broadcasters have also slammed the ban.

Past initiatives to broaden the use of Ukrainian have met with limited success. A law introduced last year making it mandatory to produce Ukrainian-only advertising has been widely ignored.

Schevchenko, of the television and radio council, says Ukraine faces the prospect of Russian superseding Ukrainian: ""Our working group that collected data has identified a situation whereby Ukraine is becoming a unique country in Europe because it is losing its own language, which is being squeezed out by the official language of another country.""

Ukrainian officials say they are considering the creation of a special department to actively promote the use of Ukrainian."

For a period, language issues were merely regulated—in a very general way—by Ukraine’s Constitution, on the one hand, and by international treaties such as the “European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages” (ECRML), on the other.  Ukraine’s Constitution guarantees the status of Ukrainian as the country’s only state language (Ukrainian has had this legal status since the language law of 1989). As for the ECRML, it has played an awkward role in Ukraine inasmuch as it has almost exclusively been abused to promote Russian, a language that does not fulfill the criteria of a regional or minority language at all, as I argued in my book Language Policy and the Discourse on Languages in Ukraine under President Viktor Yanukovych (Stuttgart: ibidem, 2013). The immediate predecessor of the current language law—the Kivalov-Kolesnychenko law of the Yanukovych regime that was adopted in August 2012—perfectly mirrored these strategies. Under the disguise of “the protection of regional or minority languages” the law clearly undermined the status of Ukrainian as a state language, as it allowed to use Russian in almost every situation not parallel to the use of the state language, but in its stead. For a number of reasons, the law of 2012 was eventually declared unconstitutional in February 2018, which was an important step.

As for the new language law of 2019, I have always publicly supported it and here is why. First, the law does not come from concrete political actors, but originates from Ukrainian civil society. Second, the law is the precise opposite of the mendacious law of 2012 to the extent that it effectively supports the constitutional status of Ukrainian as a state language. Finally, this law will help to reverse processes that paradoxically did not come to an end even in independent Ukraine—namely, the discrimination against Ukrainian speakers in their own country.

Contrary to widespread (and often propagandistic) rumors, the new language law, of course, does not ban the Russian language—or any other language—in Ukraine. The law merely helps to establish Ukrainian as a true state language, that is, a language that brings together speakers of various ethnic or linguistic backgrounds, as in many other countries around the world.

In his opinion piece, Tomasz Kamusella suggests that the standardization of a separate Ukrainian variant of Russian might be an effective weapon in counteracting Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and, moreover, the very ideology of Russkii mir. I will not discuss this assumption in detail. In my view, however, Russia’s alleged intention “to protect Russian speakers” is nothing more than a pretext for its recent wars in the post-Soviet space.

What seems to be more important is the fact that Kamusella (and others) overlook a very important detail: It is definitely true that “Spanish-speakers in Colombia or Mexico are not Spaniards,” but the dominant language in Colombia, Mexico, and other former Spanish colonies is Spanish. It is also true that “English-speakers in Australia or the United States are not English,” but the dominant language in these and other former British colonies is English. Finally, it is true that “German-speakers in Austria or Switzerland are not Germans,” but for various historical reasons the dominant language in Germany and Austria is German, which is also one of the dominant languages of Switzerland. To my knowledge, none of the above-mentioned states puts particular effort into the standardization of languages other than Spanish, English, and German, respectively (I will not discuss Switzerland’s particular situation at this point). And, by the way, is the history of the language situation in Ukraine really so similar to that in the U.S., or Argentina, or Austria? Does it not rather remind us of the language situation in Ireland, although, fortunately, Ukrainian is in a much better position than Gaelic?

In my view, Ukraine has good reason to finally focus on the standardization of Ukraine’s only state language, i. e., Ukrainian. After all, Ukrainians are well aware that the current difficult language situation is first and foremost a result of a history of oppression. The new language law will help to finally standardize the Ukrainian language in Ukraine successfully, i.e., to accomplish the implementation of the Ukrainian standard language among the population of Ukraine. To make this happen, Ukraine needs a lot of resources which barely leave room for a project that does not look particularly promising from the outset.

Aside from that, if the project of standardizing Russian in Ukraine should prove to be in any way successful, this would inevitably lead to the rise of the prestige of the Russian language in Ukraine. This is not desirable as it would eventually add fuel to the idea that Russian should be recognized as the second state language of Ukraine and, in the long run, to the “Belarusization” of Ukraine.

What might be the substance of this potential Ukrainian variant of Russian? As we know, what is good standard Russian has always been defined by the Russian Academy of Sciences, beginning with Mikhail Lomonosov. As a result, the high variety of Russian that is spoken in Ukraine differs from the Russian high variety of Russian only slightly, if at all. Lower varieties are, by contrast, extremely diverse, and it is not likely that anybody who is in favor of the idea to raise the prestige of Russian in Ukraine would embrace a standard developed on the basis of these lower varieties.

Is Russian, by the way, really as “global” as Kamusella argues? I am not so sure. Yes, it is a language that is still widespread in large parts of the post-Soviet world, but outside Russia it is most often a minority language or a foreign language (which is, by the way, increasingly replaced with English). Yes, there are Russian-speaking groups in the U.S. or in Israel or elsewhere as well—but the same is true of Polish or Ukrainian, and I have not heard anything about any initiatives to establish a Brighton Beach standard of Russian.

To conclude, I am certain that Ukraine does not need a “State Institute of Ukrainian Russian” at all. Incidentally, the petition of 2015 that called for the “introduction of a Ukrainian standard of Russian,” which is referred to in Kamusella’s opinion piece, seems to demonstrate that most Ukrainians would agree: after all, only 19 (!) people supported the petition.

Russian deserves to be protected in Ukraine as a minority language, according to Ukraine’s Constitution and other laws of Ukraine. Overall, however, Ukraine’s language policy should focus on the empowerment of Ukrainian, not Russian."

Other Briefers Declare Russian Language Gradually Being Destroyed

The Security Council heard today dissenting assertions from three briefers — two calling attention to Russophobia in Ukraine and one countering that claim as a colonial endeavour to justify war crimes — in a meeting requested by the Russian Federation, as delegates weighed in with their own prescriptions.

Kirill Vyshinsky, Executive Director of Rossiya Segodnya, detailing several examples of modern Ukrainian Russophobia, spotlighted the forceful expulsion of the Russian people, lies against Moscow and the open hatred of Russians.  Despite nearly one third of Ukraine’s population referring to Russian as its native language, the last 20 years have seen a deliberate shrinking of space.  Ukrainian authorities have stopped any study of Russian language, eliminated it from schools, removed books and prohibited those in higher education from speaking it, even in private.  There has also been a mass renaming of cities and streets; the destruction of monuments; and the seizure of churches.  “We see an ideology of hatred for everything Russian, hatred of Russians, hatred of anyone who is somehow linked to Russia,” he underscored.

Dmitry Vasilets, Deputy Head of the Ukrainian Trade Union of Law Workers, noting that he speaks on behalf of the millions of Russian citizens in Ukraine, added that speaking Russian was prohibited in schools beginning in 2020 and then in movie theatres, public buildings and other locations since 2021.  “That is barbarism that has been enshrined in law by [Ukraine President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy,” he stated, emphasizing that the use of one’s mother tongue is a human right protected under international law.  Citing various instances of discrimination, including on social media platforms, he declared that “the Russian language is gradually being destroyed”.

Timothy Snyder, Professor of History at Yale University, pointed out that the term “Russophobia” is an attempt to justify the Russian Federation’s war crimes in Ukraine.  The harm being done to Russians and Russian Federation culture is primarily due to Moscow’s own policies and actions, he countered, spotlighting the emigration of creative Russians due to its invasion of Ukraine; destruction of independent Russian journalism; attacks on culture, books, museums and other landmarks; mass killings of Russian speakers and citizens; and Russian Federation State television proclamations.  The claim that Ukrainians are sick with a disease called “Russophobia” is simply colonial rhetoric and part of a larger strategy of hate speech, he stressed.

As the floor opened for discussion, the representative of the Russian Federation said that his country convened today’s meeting to underscore the threat of Ukraine’s Russophobia to international peace and security.  What is happening now — from language bans to book burnings — is linguistic inquisition and obscurantism for which innocent people are suffering and dying.  A long-term and sustainable peace in Europe cannot be built on Russophobia, he underlined, emphasizing that no condemnation of Moscow’s special military operation by the West can explain the Russophobia in those countries.

Challenging this assertion, Ukraine’s representative stressed that the mass graves in Bucha, Mariupol, Izium and other places have demonstrated the power of Moscow’s war propaganda in dehumanizing Ukrainians.  This is a real hatred that has been deliberately fuelled for decades; directed against Ukraine; and resulted in war crimes, crimes against humanity and the breaking of that country’s sovereignty.  In that regard, a future tribunal must establish accountability for all those who issued criminal orders and those who implemented and whitewashed them, he insisted.

The representative of Malta, asserting that today’s meeting is yet another cynical attempt to justify the unjustifiable, deplored Moscow’s dissemination of disinformation and misinformation.  Despite today’s narratives which aimed to portray the victim as the aggressor and the aggressor as the victim, the facts are clear for all to see, he said.  Moscow must stop its current war and the Council must redouble its efforts to ensure accountability and justice for victims.

Brazil’s delegate pointed out that “the mere repetition of national positions, in a format that shows clear signs of exhaustion, will contribute nothing to the end of the conflict”.  It would have been more productive to discuss pragmatic means to achieve peace, a concept that has been largely absent from the Council’s debates, he maintained.

Mozambique’s representative, Council President for March, speaking in his national capacity, warned parties against using toxic language.  Such language creates an atmosphere of fear and distrust; adds fuel to an already acrimonious and destructive conflict; and makes the prospect for peace all the more fragile.  “Given the global visibility of the conflict, the charged rhetoric that has become common amongst the belligerents risks normalizing hatred and incitement in other parts of the globe,” he cautioned.

In a similar vein, the representative of the United Arab Emirates stressed that the hatred of any group strips away empathy at a time when understanding is most needed.  When the guns are eventually silenced, such intolerance and bigotry can hamper post-conflict reconciliation and sustainable peace.  Against this backdrop, the Council must redouble its efforts to address the proliferation of hate speech and intolerance as “a worldview that supports xenophobia serves no one”.

Building on this, China’s delegate called on the international community to eliminate estrangement, prejudice and hatred.  When phobias are used as a policy pretext, countries magnify differences, create imaginary enemies, concoct threat theories and pursue suppression while dragging the world into a quagmire of conflicts and disputes.  Humanity is wise and capable enough to overcome these phobias by engaging in dialogue and tolerance instead of confrontation and exclusion, he said, emphasizing that “together, we can build a new type of international relations based on mutual respect, fairness and win-win cooperation”.

Also speaking today were representatives of Japan, Gabon, United Kingdom, France, Ecuador, Albania, Ghana, Switzerland and the United States.

The Russian Federation took the floor a second time and again in response to Mr. Snyder.

The meeting began at 10:06 a.m. and ended at 12:15 p.m.

Briefings

KIRILL VYSHINSKY, Executive Director of Rossiya Segodnya, noting that he was a journalist who worked in various Ukrainian media outlets, was arrested by security forces on a concocted pretext and went to the Russian Federation following his release, defined Russophobia as a demonstration and imposition of hostility against the Russian Federation’s people, its State and citizens.  This rejection of that civilization’s status and culture is being doing publicly on media outlets and the Internet in a targeted fashion.  Anyone who feels they are the Russian is having the right to life, dignity and free movement curtailed, he said before detailing several egregious examples of modern Ukrainian Russophobia.  Among other things, there was a misanthropic call on Ukrainian television for Russians to be dealt with by destroying their families and children; a Ukrainian doctor who urged the castration of war prisoners because they are “cockroaches rather than people”; and an advertisement where a Russian soldier’s throat was being cut as the words “now we are exacting our bloody revenge on all of you” were said.

This is being implemented in practice, he stressed, noting that prisoners of war have faced atrocities and civilians have been shot in the Russian-speaking region of the Donbas.  In March, Ukraine announced a draft bill introducing the concept of Rashism.  There is also the forceful expulsion of the Russian people, lies being told against Moscow and open hatred of the Russian Federation and Russians not only in Ukraine, but also in other parts of the world, such as the European Union.  For example, Poland’s Prime Minister admitted in March 2022 that Russophobia was already the mainstream.

Russians are the second most numerous community in Ukraine, numbering in the millions, he pointed out.  Nearly one third of the population — over 14 million people — refer to the Russian language as a native language.  Those who constantly speak Russian or use Russian are 53 per cent of the population.  Yet, over the last 20 years, there has been a deliberate shrinking of the sphere for the use of that language.  Discrimination against the Russian language is in the media and throughout the country, he asserted.  Ukrainian authorities have stopped any study of that language, eliminated it from schools and said they would remove a large number of books.  While books are not being burned demonstrably like the Nazis did in the 1930s, they are nevertheless being thrown into the trash.  Everyone in higher education cannot speak Russian — not even in private — and is being supported by Ukraine’s ombudsman who promised to broaden and introduce this practice to other institutions, he continued.

He then spotlighted other manifestations of Russophobia which included a humanitarian catastrophe resulting from the cessation of freshwater through Crimean channels; the mass renaming of cities and streets; the destruction of a number of monuments; and the attacks and seizures of churches.  “I could give you many facts about the Russophobia policies of the Ukrainian authorities — they reached their peak in 2022 and 2023,” he said, adding:  “But, the conclusion is simple:  recently Ukraine has seen systematic attempts in various areas of education, culture and the economy and everyday life.  We see an ideology of hatred for everything Russian, hatred of Russians, hatred of anyone who is somehow linked to Russia.”

DMITRY VASILETS, Deputy Head of the Ukrainian Trade Union of Law Workers, noting that he speaks on behalf of the millions of Russian citizens in Ukraine, said that country’s Constitution enshrines the right to speak and use different languages, including Russian.  However, the criminal regime of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy represses the use of the Russian language.  Beginning in 2020, speaking Russian was prohibited in Ukrainian schools, and in 2021 and 2022, it began to be prohibited in movie theatres, public buildings and other locations across Ukraine.  Those found speaking Russian were even fined.  “That is the barbarism that has been enshrined in law by Zelenskyy,” he stressed, noting that over 70 per cent of Ukrainians remain in favour of studying the Russian language in schools.  Emphasizing that the use of one’s mother tongue is a human right protected under international law, he described the situation in Ukraine as a case of “linguicide”.

Urging the Council’s members to imagine not being allowed to speak or think in their own native language, he recounted his own experiences of being discriminated against for speaking Russian in Ukraine.  Today, against the backdrop of the war and great humanitarian need, even humanitarian aid is being withheld from those who need it, if those seeking it do not address the authorities in Ukrainian.  At least 30 per cent of Ukrainian citizens remain unable to use their own language.  Recalling the adoption of a law that enshrined the Ukrainian language as the country’s official State language, he said that move impacted other ethnic communities — including Hungarians — but hit Russian-speakers hardest.  He also noted that the use of some European languages, such as those spoken in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, is tolerated over the use of others.  Citing various specific instances of discrimination, including on social media platforms, he declared that “the Russian language is gradually being destroyed” in Ukraine, which is totally unacceptable in the twenty-first century.

TIMOTHY SNYDER, Professor of History at Yale University, describing himself as a historian of mass atrocities and other crimes, said the term “Russophobia” itself clarifies certain things about the war.  First, it shows that the harm being done to Russians and to Russian culture is primarily a matter of Moscow’s own policies and actions.  Indeed, the term “Russophobia” itself is a form of imperial propaganda and an attempt to justify Moscow’s war crimes in Ukraine.  Noting that he shares concerns over the harm being done to Russians today, he urged the Council to consider which actions over the past year have done the most harm to Russian people and culture.  First, Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine has caused some of the most creative and productive Russians to emigrate away from the country.  Meanwhile, independent Russian journalism has been destroyed, “so that Russians cannot know the world around them”.  Citing a general trend towards censorship in the Russian Federation, he said that, in that country, hold a sign that reads “no to war” is likely to lead to imprisonment.

He went on to describe attacks on Russian culture through the destruction of books, museums and other cultural landmarks — all parts of the Russian Federation’s own State policy — and added that the idea of the “Great Motherland War” has also been perverted by associating it with a war being fought in 2023.  He also drew attention to the mass killing of Russian speakers, and of the Russian Federation’s citizens, in Ukraine as a result of Moscow’s own invasion.  Meanwhile, a generation of young Russian fighters — those that survive the war — will have been involved in war crimes, and find themselves wrapped up in guilt for the rest of their lives.  However, he said, the very worst harm to the Russian people and culture is the State’s broad normalization of the idea of genocide.  Indeed, Russian State television continues to present Ukrainians as pigs, worms, Satanists and ghouls, and proclaim that Ukrainian children should be drowned.  “If we were sincerely concerned about Russians, we would be concerned about what Russian State policy is doing to Russians,” he stressed.

Moreover, he continued, the term “Russophobia” is part of a long-standing rhetorical strategy used by an empire when it attacks, claiming that it is, in fact, the victim.  Citing the obvious and massive destruction of Ukraine, he said the setting of a war matters.  The idea that the Russian Federation is the victim — even as it carries out a war of atrocity in Ukraine — is meant to distract from the experience of the real victims, in the real world.  Against that backdrop, he rejected Moscow’s assertion that “our hurt feelings count more than other people’s lives”.  The claim that Ukrainians are sick with a disease called “Russophobia” is simply a type of colonial rhetoric and part of a larger strategy of hate speech, he said.

Statements

VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), requesting Mr. Snyder to provide examples, noted that his fairy tales and attempts at historical engineering shatter against historical facts.  In delivering a brief overview of history, he pointed out that Russophobia has become Ukraine’s bullwork ideology.  While 17.3 per cent of Ukraine’s population considered themselves as Russians in the 2001 census and 30 per cent refer to Russian as their native language, that country’s nationalist Government launched a brutal attack on all things Russian.  Authorities were ready to kill Russian-speaking Ukrainians as demonstrated by the burning of more than 40 Russian-speaking activists in Odessa in May 2014 and the quotes of several figures — such as Dmitry Yarosh, the leader of the extremist Right Sector organization — in the days following the coup d’état of that year.  Ukraine’s attempt to repeal a law on its language policy notably provoked Crimea’s separation and protests among Donbas’ inhabitants.  For nine years, Ukrainian authorities have systematically destroyed everything that could be linked to Moscow, undermining the basis of a society that existed in cultural and civilizational unity with the Russian Federation for centuries.  It has also discriminated and violated its international and constitutional commitments, he added.

Following the 2019 election, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy armed his country with Western aid, prepared for war with the Russian Federation and called on all residents who considered themselves Russians to leave his country, he continued.  Those who did not — namely the residents of the Donbas — were then bombed, shelled and destroyed, not as a response to the Russian Federation’s actions, but rather out of the purposeful attempt to destroy Russian language and culture in an egregious violation of the Russian-speaking population’s rights.  Highlighting several quotes, which, among other things, referred to the Russian people as “rats” who should be poisoned and destroyed, he stressed that what is happening now in Ukraine — from language bans to book burnings — is linguistic inquisition and obscurantism for which innocent people are suffering and dying.  Yet, the West did not react to this at all.  No condemnation of Moscow’s special military operation can explain the extent of Russophobia in those countries, he asserted.  He then directed the Council’s attention to Kyiv’s seizure of churches, parishes and monasteries and emphasized that his country convened today’s meeting to point out the threat of Ukraine’s Russophobia to international peace and security.  A long-term and sustainable peace in Europe cannot be built on Russophobia, he underscored.

JOÃO GENÉSIO DE ALMEIDA FILHO (Brazil) said that, last week, once again, missiles struck various civilian areas of Ukraine.  Deploring that use of violence and renewing his appeal for dialogue and a ceasefire, he said the Security Council’s attention has so far not produced any results on the ground.  He encouraged a reflection on the current dynamics of the Council’s meetings — and on the role of the Council — while pointing out:  “The mere repetition of national positions, in a format that shows clear signs of exhaustion, will contribute nothing to the end of the conflict.”  At the same time, Brazil stands against efforts to isolate the Russian Federation at diplomatic fora and through unilateral sanctions, which are not approved by the Council.  At this point, it would be more productive to discuss pragmatic means to achieve peace, a concept that has been largely absent from the organ’s debates.  Grievances and security concerns from both sides will have to be addressed.  Turning to the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which is about to expire, he urged the parties to seek a swift renewal and encouraged all Member States to avoid actions that may compromise its implementation.

MAGOSAKI KAORU (Japan) noted that various forms of discrimination, harmful rhetoric and incitement related to the war in Ukraine exist.  While that must never be tolerated, it nevertheless remains true that no allegations of discrimination can justify the use of force.  “If anything, the unlawful Russian invasion of Ukraine might actually have given rise to harmful rhetoric and incitement towards those who align themselves with the unjustifiable aggression,” he stressed.  In line with the resolutions of the General Assembly, he reiterated the demand for Moscow’s immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders, and for a cessation of all hostilities.

CHRISTOPHE NANGA (Gabon) voiced his deep concern that “there is nothing positive on the horizon” with respect to the conflict in Ukraine and its impact on entire generations of people.  Calling on the parties to show restraint and refrain from incitement to hatred, he said such actions will only push a political solution and lasting peace further away.  The parties should take action to fight hate speech and abide by the provision of the Charter of the United Nations, which prohibit discriminatory language based on any forms of identity.  He joined other speakers in appealing to the parties to come to the table and urgently agree on a political resolution.

MOHAMED ISSA ABUSHAHAB (United Arab Emirates) stressed that the hatred of any group is an exercise in closing the mind that succeeds in stripping away empathy at a time when understanding is most needed.  His country has consistently taken a strong stance against intolerance in all its forms, he noted, emphasizing the collective responsibility of the Council to ensure that respect for others becomes the global norm.  In areas of conflict, the Council has seen intolerance taken to the extreme in that lives are lost, communities destroyed and histories erased.  When the guns are eventually silenced, intolerance and bigotry can hamper post-conflict reconciliation and sustainable peace.  As such, the Council must redouble its efforts to address the proliferation of hate speech and intolerance, including through modern technology.  The Council must also prioritize conflict resolution and ultimately a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine as a lasting peace must be its objective, he insisted.  Welcoming the efforts of all parties towards the extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, he pointed out that its existence shows the promise of constructive dialogue even in the midst of conflict.  “A worldview that supports xenophobia serves no one,” he emphasized.

FERGUS JOHN ECKERSLEY (United Kingdom) said “Russophobia” is just another in Moscow’s ever-growing list of excuses to justify its war in Ukraine.  “The fact that they are inventing so many of these is itself a good indication that they know none of them stands up to full scrutiny,” he said, declaring:  “We are not Russophobes […] we do not want Russia to fail as a State, as the Russian delegation sometimes claims.”  Instead, the United Kingdom desires a Russian Federation that is prosperous and stable — “just one that does not invade and try to annex its neighbours”.  Outlining the massive cost of war over the past year, he cited thousands of deaths and widespread reports of atrocities.  To build domestic support for his war, President Vladimir V. Putin’s Government is pushing out propaganda about Ukraine, aimed at dehumanizing the people it is killing and delegitimizing the country it is invading.  “All while falsely claiming that Russia is somehow the victim,” he said, rejecting false claims that Ukrainians are neo-Nazis, “cockroaches”, “grunting pigs” or “scum and freaks”, and calling for an end to the killing and propaganda.

DIARRA DIME LABILLE (France) pointed out that Russian Federation is once again tying to divert attention by alleging the existence of discrimination so that the Council looks away from the atrocities and abuses Moscow continues to commit in Ukraine.  This strategy is not new, she noted, emphasizing that Moscow has sought to distort reality since the beginning of its war of aggression.  However, this propaganda strategy does not work and Moscow will not succeed in its unjustifiable war by cultivating the myth of so-called Russophobia.  The reality is that the Russian Federation is carrying out illegal and unjustified aggression against a sovereign State, Ukraine, in flagrant violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.  This aggression goes hand in hand with mass violations constituting war crimes and crimes against humanity, she continued before emphasizing that her Government’s resolve is stronger than ever.  France will stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine for as long as necessary, ensure that justice is done and support the efforts of Ukrainian courts and the International Criminal Court.  She called on the Russian Federation to withdraw its troops from Ukraine and fully respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of that embattled country.

MONICA SOLEDAD SANCHEZ IZQUIERDO (Ecuador) rejected all forms of racial discrimination, xenophobia and related forms on intolerance in any context — be it during peace or war — and regardless of origin.  Rejecting also the corrosive narratives exacerbating the conflict, she pointed out that they are all the more appalling in seeking to justify armed violence.  “What greater act of xenophobia, contempt or dehumanization can there be than war?”, she asked.  In addition to claiming human lives, destroying civil infrastructure and ruining livelihoods, war affects the full enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedoms, and is a pretext for the violations and abuses of these rights.  She then called on the Russian Federation to withdraw its military forces from Ukraine’s territory within its internally recognized borders and cease hostilities as demanded by the General Assembly on a comprehensive, just and lasting peace adopted during its eleventh emergency special session on 23 February.

ARIAN SPASSE (Albania), recalling a June 2022 Council meeting on the topic “incitement to violence leading to atrocity crimes”, said that at the time, delegations referenced many historical examples — from the genocide in Rwanda to the Holocaust during the Second World War — in which massive atrocity crimes were planned and executed, based first on the dehumanization of an entire people.  The same is now happening in Ukraine, he said, noting that calls for “de-Ukrainization” are now being followed by atrocity crimes — killings, deportation of civilians and the destruction of cultural sites, among others.  However, Ukrainians today are more united than ever, and are heroically defending their country.  “The world has been clear in distinguishing the wrong from the right, the perpetrators from the victims,” he stressed, recalling that the majority of United Nations Member States recently voted in the General Assembly to condemn Moscow’s aggression in Ukraine.  Moscow’s self-imposed isolation is not a result of Russophobia, but of the fact that the world is not ready to accept its crimes, invasion and violations of international law, he said.

KHALILAH HACKMAN (Ghana) urged all Council members to remain focused on efforts to resolve the aggression against Ukraine and to address the concerns of civilians.  “While we do not underrate the potential for the perceived concerns of ‘Russophobia’ to be an underlying driver for the actions of some parties in the war against Ukraine, our assessments do not lead us to conclude that there is systematic and widespread State action against ethnic Russian-speaking citizens of Ukraine,” she said.  What lies underneath such accusations is, in fact, the attempt by a larger neighbour to assert — through brute force and subterfuge — dominance over its smaller neighbour.  Voicing her strong condemnation of all violations of human rights and freedoms, she said such mechanisms such as the Human Rights Council, Council of Europe, International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court provide appropriate channels for redressing such abuses.  She also underscored the need to adhere to the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of another State, noting that the Russian Federation’s choice of force against Ukraine “excessively outweighs any threats it perceives as arising from ethnic-related attacks against Russian speaking people”.

DARREN CAMILLERI (Malta), noting that today’s meeting is yet another cynical attempt to justify the unjustifiable, reiterated his country’s strong condemnation of the Russian Federation’s aggression.  Despite today’s narratives, which aimed to portray the victim as the aggressor and the aggressor as the victim, the facts are clear for all to see, he asserted as he deplored Moscow’s dissemination of disinformation and misinformation.  Stressing that there is no alternative to multilateralism and the rules-based international order, he urged all to fully implement the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and other pertinent human rights treaties.  For its part, Moscow must also respect the International Court of Justice’s April 2017 order on provisional measures concerning the application of that Convention and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.  Regarding the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, he called on the Council to redouble its efforts to ensure accountability for all violations, which must include justice for victims of atrocity crimes and sexual violence, as well as the abductions and forcible deportation of children.  As an important first step, Malta supports establishing a register of damages.  He then reiterated his Government’s full support for Ukraine and called on Moscow to stop its war.

ANDREA BARBARA BAUMANN-BRESOLIN (Switzerland), noting that the “truth is the first casualty of war”, stressed the importance of avoiding propaganda, hate speech and divisive language.  The misinformation and propaganda that accompany the war against Ukraine reinforce mistrust, deepen divisions and increase hostility, she added.  Opposing all attempts to justify the Russian Federation’s military aggression against Ukraine, she insisted Moscow cease all combat operations and withdraw its troops from Ukraine’s territory without delay.  Noting that information that is fabricated and disseminated to cause harm can never form the basis for frank and constructive dialogue, she urged Council members to refrain from and oppose harmful rhetoric.

GENG SHUANG (China), reiterating his Government’s willingness to play a constructive role, urged the international community to support the peaceful settlement of the conflict.  To stop wars, the international community must eliminate estrangement, prejudice and hatred and sow the seeds of peace, solidarity and friendship.  Regrettably, however, phobias have become the logical premise and policy pretext with which certain countries create imaginary enemies, concoct threat theories, pursue containment and suppression and stoke division and confrontation.  As a result, differences are magnified artificially; disagreements are hyped up to the neglect of commonalities; tensions are reinforced and perpetuated and the world is dragged into the quagmire of conflicts and disputes.  Noting that some politicians have contracted Sinophobia, he cautioned against a zero-sum-game mentality, the perpetuation of policies of containment and suppression, and confrontation.  “The world has already been thrown into chaos by the Ukrainian crisis — do they want to create another one to change the world beyond recognition,” he asked.  Humanity is wise and capable enough to overcome various phobias and get along through dialogue instead of confrontation and tolerance instead of exclusion, he said, adding that “together, we can build a new type of international relations based on mutual respect, fairness and win-win cooperation”.

JOHN KELLEY (United States) welcomed all serious discussions on the detrimental impacts of hate speech and harmful rhetoric.  However, he expressed regret that today’s meeting was not harnessed for that purpose.  Referring to the Russian Federation’s many claims that it is the victim of the current war, he said the term in English for such assertions is “gaslighting”.  Over the last year, the world has heard countless excuses for Moscow’s aggression — claims that the Russian Federation is not the aggressor, that it must “de-Nazify” the Ukrainian Government and that it must fight drug addicts and Satanists in eastern Ukraine.  However, nothing can obscure one central fact:  “Russia is not the victim that it claims to be.”  Urging Moscow to address the real actions committed by its forces on the ground — including war crimes, torture of those in detention, deportation of Ukrainian children and the rape of Ukrainian women — he said the string of propaganda emanating from Moscow is only intended to mask the true goal, namely erasing Ukraine from the map and subjugating its people.  Against that backdrop, he said, Ukraine’s self-defence is an appropriate and necessary response to a war of aggression that violates the Charter of the United Nations and has caused unspeakable suffering.

DOMINGOS ESTÊVÃO FERNANDES (Mozambique), Council President for March, speaking in his national capacity, reiterated his grave concern over the continued escalation of the conflict in Ukraine and the harmful rhetoric and incitement to violence used by parties to the war.  “Given the global visibility of the conflict, the charged rhetoric that has become common amongst the belligerents risks normalizing hatred and incitement in other parts of the globe,” he warned.  Such language not only creates an atmosphere of fear and distrust, but also adds fuel to an already acrimonious and destructive conflict and makes attempts at finding a negotiated solution difficult, and the prospects for peaceful coexistence more fragile.  Citing calls by the Secretary-General, he warned the parties against using such toxic language and called upon their respective leaders to earnestly commit to peaceful solutions in line with tenets of the Charter of the United Nations.

Mr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), taking the floor a second time, said that some Council members have energetically and unconvincingly attempted to bring examples of hateful statements.  The quotes and citations advanced in the Council do not work because it was the Ukrainian authorities and not the Ukrainian people that are the issue, he pointed out.  “Where did you hear at least one call to the de-Ukrainization of Ukraine or to wipe Ukraine off the map?”, he asked, noting that his Government is concerned for Ukrainians and is wondering what led them to the criminal regime in their country.

SERHII DVORNYK (Ukraine), spotlighting the brutal execution of the Ukrainian solider Oleksandr Matsiievskyi for saying “Glory to Ukraine”, pointed out that the horrific footage being circulated has reminded all of how hatred kills.  This is a real hatred — and not fabricated stories that the Council has been obliged to listen to — that has been deliberately fuelled for decades; been directed towards an entire nation; and triggered the breaking of a country’s sovereignty, war crimes and crimes against humanity.  Noting that he would discuss recent developments on the ground at a later meeting in the week, he voiced his regret — but not surprise — that the Russian Federation flooded the Council with superfluous requests.  Such a response manifests its weakness and lack of credible arguments, he pointed out, adding that Moscow is prompted by its fear and realization of imminent accountability.  The mass graves in Bucha, Mariupol, Izium and dozens of other places have proven the power of the Russian Federation’s war propaganda in dehumanizing Ukrainians and removing any moral safeguard from its soldiers’ mindsets.  Article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prohibits any national hatred and war propaganda that constitute an incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, he emphasized.

The history of the past contains powerful reminders of when one nation — poisoned with propaganda and hatred — waged a war of elimination against other peoples and nations, he continued.  False claims about the discrimination of Germans were used as a justification for aggressive expansionism, annexations and atrocities.  With so many similarities to the Russian Federation’s course of action, it is clear that the Kremlin’s criminal regime should also find itself in the docks after their miliary defeat in Ukraine, he said.  It will be up to the future tribunal to establish accountability for all those responsible for issuing criminal orders, implementing them and whitewashing them for internal and international audiences, he then declared.  That tribunal should also facilitate a process of moral penance and deep reflection where the Russian Federation can contemplate the role of its leaders and army in committing atrocities in Ukraine.  Such a reflection — if underpinned with trials, remembrance, education and reparations — can notably result in that country’s return to the family of civilized nations and a commitment to never repeat the horrors of the war against Ukraine, he said.  He called on all Member States to engage actively in ensuring justice for all victims by holding all perpetrators accountable.

Mr. SNYDER, responding to the Russian Federation request for sources, referred to him to his President’s website which showcases his speeches denying Ukraine’s existence on the grounds it was invented by Nazis and by communists and that a Viking baptized himself a thousand years ago.  “I do not comment on the historical validity of these arguments — I simply point out that these are a matter of public record; these are the statements of the President of the Russian Federation,” he said.  He also referred him to the genocidal remarks of Dmitry Medvedev on his Telegram channel and clarified that he was simply quoting the Russian Federation’s State television which are significant not only as expressions of the Russian Federation, but also as a mark of genocidal motivation for the Russian population.  Presenters on Russian Federation television themselves have been worried aloud about the possibility of being prosecuted for war crimes.  Regarding questions on the sources of atrocities in Ukraine, he pointed out that the simplest thing to do would be to allow Russian journalists to report freely from Ukraine and for everyone else to visit Ukraine and ask its people about the war.  “As a historian of Russia, I look forward to the day when there can be free discussion of Russia’s fascinating history,” he said as he referred that country’s representatives to even more resources.  “To claim that a country has no history is genocidal hate speech, and in that sense, and only in that sense, this session has been useful,” he added.

Mr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), responding, noted that Mr. Snyder had not responded to his question and instead delivered another briefing.

Mr. VASILETS, taking the floor a second time, reminded the representative of Ukraine that he, in fact, represents an entire country — including many people who are Russian-speaking and have Russian heritage.  Turning to Mr. Snyder, who seems to represent the views of NATO countries, he pointed out that the bloc’s weapons have caused great suffering and mass destruction in Ukraine.  While Western politicians often come to Bucha and other destroyed cities for photo opportunities, not a single cent in reconstruction funding has yet actually been received, he stressed."
https://www.bbc.com/news/64718139,does ukrainian army have nazi ideology?,0,"Title: Ukraine war: President Putin speech fact-checked. President Vladimir Putin addressed the Russian public in a national address which lasted for almost two hours.
In the speech, he made a series of claims about the war in Ukraine and was highly critical of Western countries.
We've looked into some of his statements.
'The neo-Nazi regime that set up in Ukraine after 2014'
Mr Putin has repeatedly made baseless claims about a ""neo-Nazi regime"" in Ukraine as a justification for Russia's invasion of the country.
In Ukraine's last parliamentary election in 2019, support for far-right candidates was 2%, far lower than in many other European countries.

It should also be noted that President Volodymyr Zelensky is Jewish and members of his family died in the Holocaust.
But there have been far-right groups in Ukraine - the most high-profile is the Azov regiment - elements of which have expressed support for Nazi ideology.

From 2022: Ros Atkins on... Putin’s false Nazi claims about Ukraine
It was formed to resist Russian-backed separatists, who seized areas of eastern Ukraine in 2014, and was subsequently absorbed as a unit within the Ukrainian military.
'One of the brigades of the Ukrainian armed forces... was awarded the name Edelweiss, like the Hitler division'
Here, Mr Putin drew a comparison between a Ukrainian army unit and the Nazis' 1st Mountain Division - which had the Edelweiss flower on its insignia and committed war crimes in the Second World War.


On 14 February, President Zelensky gave the 10th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade the honorary title: Edelweiss.
The next day, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs highlighted this as ""evidence"" of Nazis in Ukraine in a tweet.
But the Edelweiss flower - which grows in Alpine regions - has been used as a symbol by other European mountain military divisions, including the Croatian Mountain Rescue Service, Swiss Army generals and the 21st Rifles Brigade of Poland.
Even Russia had a special unit called Edelweiss. The 17th special purpose detachment of Rosgvardia was given this title in 2011. The name was changed to Avanguard in 2016.
'We also remember the attempts of the Kyiv regime to acquire nuclear weapons, because they talked about it publicly'
There is no evidence that Ukraine has attempted to acquire nuclear weapons, and Mr Putin - who has made this claim before - did not provide any.


When it was part of the former Soviet Union, nuclear weapons were based in Ukraine, but in 1994 Ukraine signed up to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and gave them up, in return for security guarantees.
In 2021, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, suggested that if Ukraine couldn't join Nato, it might have to reconsider its nuclear-free status.
In 2022, President Zelensky said that although Ukraine had ""abandoned"" its nuclear capabilities, it had ""no security"".
But the Ukrainian government has not expressed an intention to acquire nuclear weapons and a military strategy document published in 2021 did not refer to them.
The UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), says it has seen no signs in Ukraine ""of the diversion of nuclear material, intended for peaceful activities, for other purposes.""

'GDP in 2022 has decreased by only 2.1% and I'll remind you that in February or March they predicted a collapse of the Russian economy'
Mr Putin is right that the Russian economy has shrunk by less than expected.
Russia's statistics agency says the economy measured by GDP contracted by 2.1%, which is close to the 2.2% estimate in the latest report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
That contraction still makes it the worst-performing country on the IMF's list, but the organisation confirms that it has contracted by less than expected.

https://theintercept.com/2022/06/30/ukraine-azov-neo-nazi-foreign-fighter/,does ukrainian army have nazi ideology?,0,"Title: FOREIGN FIGHTERS IN UKRAINE COULD BE A TIME BOMB FOR THEIR HOME COUNTRIES
Two killed in the Ukrainian Army’s International Legion may have been neo-Nazis.

THE DEATH OF a French volunteer in Ukraine is the first clear evidence that there are at least some far-right extremists among the foreign fighters who have flocked there to fight Russian forces. Wilfried Bleriot, 32, was killed in action, according to Ukraine’s International Legion in a Facebook post on June 4, 2022. In the photo of Bleriot posted by the International Legion, which was formed after Russia’s February invasion and is open to volunteer fighters from all over the world, he displays front and center on his body armor the black-and-white patch of the so-called Misanthropic Division, said to be an overtly fascist volunteer wing of Ukraine’s ultranationalist Azov Battalion.


The Misanthropic Division’s violent, hate-filled Telegram channel was the first to announce Bleriot’s death, one day earlier, on June 3. The post said that he died on June 1 in Kharkiv and included a photo in which the thin and bearded Bleriot wears a T-shirt that says “Misanthropic Division” across the front.

Bleriot was a “man who fought bolshevism and antifascism all his life,” according to the Telegram post, a “brother-in-arms,” who died defending Europe and Ukraine from “Asiatic hordes.” Among members of the group chat, Bleriot has become a martyr, a fallen comrade to be mourned and celebrated. One meme shows a Black Sun wheel — an icon of Nazi occultism — behind his smiling face.

Bleriot was from Bayeux, a town in the north of France. In an interview with an Argentinian reporter, uploaded to Reddit on March 3, he identifies himself as a Norman, says that he is “ready to kill Russians,” and “ready to die.” He adds that he left behind two children at home, and starts to cry. Bleriot’s family could not be reached for comment. Efforts to reach French authorities for comment on whether Bleriot was known to them were also unsuccessful.

A spokesperson for the Azov Battalion, which began around 2014 as a far-right street gang and has since evolved into a professional special operations regiment of the Ukrainian army, did not immediately respond to an inquiry about Bleriot and the Misanthropic Division. But back in April, I met with Andriy Biletsky, the founder of the Azov movement, at their base in Kyiv. I had not heard of the Misanthropic Division then, but I did ask Biletsky about foreign fighters. “We have volunteers from different countries,” he told me. “We’ve had Europeans, Japanese, people from the Middle East.” He also mentioned Belarusian, Georgian, Russian, Croat, and British volunteers. He pointed out that some of them had been Jews. However, “I can assure you that there are no Americans,” he said. “Not even western Europeans for that matter,” he added, slightly contradicting himself.

The Azov base, in the semi-industrial outskirts of Kyiv, was in an abandoned Soviet factory compound. Inside the main building, a yellow flag with Azov’s notorious Wolfsangel symbol in the center hung from the rafters. In two places, there were Black Sun clocks on the walls; such sun wheels, or Sonnenrads, also found on the floor of Heinrich Himmler’s castle in Germany, are widely used by contemporary adherents of Nazi ideology to signal their Aryan supremacist beliefs. Azov apologists say that they are merely indigenous Ukrainian symbols that must be understood in an Eastern European context. In any case, the sun wheels, backlit by blue neon, certainly lent the Azov base a neo-Nazi aesthetic. There were soldiers in full battle gear walking around, looking as squared-away and intimidating as any in Ukraine, and two women who worked as secretaries. The ground floor was full of new recruits, exclusively young white men, speaking Ukrainian and Russian.

Two people were killed in another round of intense shelling between Western-backed Ukrainian government's forces and pro-Russian fighters in the separatist east, officials from both sides said. Ukraine's military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said one soldier was killed and six wounded in the past 24 hours of fighting across the mostly Russian-speaking war zone.

Since Azov formed about eight years ago, it has attracted relentless controversy for its quasi-fascist ideology, unapologetically espoused by Biletsky, and alleged abuses against the few minority groups that exist in Ukraine, including the Roma. There is plenty of photographic evidence of Azov fighters displaying Nazi symbols on the battlefield (often with the intent to troll Russia). Azov has tried to clean up its image in recent years and present itself as depoliticized, and it is now an official component of the Ukrainian military, not an independent militia. But it has far more autonomy than any other regiment of the army. It presents itself as an elite corps and has attained an extraordinary degree of prestige and admiration in the eyes of ordinary Ukrainians for its stalwart defense of Mariupol, its home base, which finally fell to the Russians on May 20, following a dramatic, three-month-long siege. Although many hundreds of Azov soldiers were taken prisoner, many more young Ukrainian men have signed up to replace them.

“Azov is growing,” Maksym Zhorin, the commander of an Azov special operations unit in Kyiv, told me in April. “Our emphasis is on the future.” He added, “It might sound weird, but the actions of the Russian federation have been beneficial for us.”

As I noted in a recent piece for Harper’s, when I left the base, I saw a small group of men hanging around outside the gate, and guessed from their appearance (paramilitary attire, neck tattoos, ball caps) that they were foreign volunteers. With several Azov soldiers standing next to my translator and me as we waited for a taxi, I didn’t think it wise to approach them, but I overheard them speaking English. The one phrase I caught distinctly, over the idling engine of an armored vehicle, was “foreign legion.” Also, who knows who was responsible for it, but “WHITE POWER” was spray-painted on the kiosk right in front of us, alongside the driveway — in English, no less.

BLERIOT’S DEATH, the possible existence of more extremists like him among the ranks of Ukraine’s foreign fighters, and the rise of Azov as an internal military power should not be taken as representative of Ukraine’s society, government, and armed forces as a whole. Russian propaganda would have people believe that Ukraine and its military are full of neo-Nazis and completely under the sway of radical Russophobes. These falsehoods evaporate as soon as you set foot in the country. Ukraine does have a notably vigorous and aggressive ultranationalist sector, but even Azov, the most powerful and influential far-right force, remains a fringe movement. Ukraine is one of the biggest countries in Europe and contains multitudes. Its president is Jewish, a former TV comedian. Before Russia invaded, issues like corruption and economic stagnation were much bigger problems in the lives of ordinary people than the specter of roving gangs of fascist youths. If the Russians were really worried about neo-Nazi, ultranationalist, and white-supremacist militants, they would look in their own country, where such movements flourish as much as, if not more than, in Ukraine.

Likewise, Bleriot should not be taken as representative of the Ukrainian Army’s International Legion. Amid the chaos of the first two months of the war, most of the foreigners who flocked to Ukraine to fight were turned away and went home. The International Legion only accepted those with substantial military experience, mostly from the U.S. and U.K. Bleriot, who told an Argentinian interviewer that he had served one year in the French army, would have barely made the cut. There’s little doubt that he claimed the Misanthropic Division’s neo-Nazi ideology, as articulated in spaces like its Telegram channel, but such extremists, isolated and small in number, also find their way into the U.S. military on a regular basis.

As for the Misanthropic Division, it’s hard to tell how real it is, and how sizable. The extent of its actual association with the Azov Battalion is also unclear. Take Bleriot, for example. There’s no indication that he was with any Azov unit when he died in Kharkiv, in the northeast of Ukraine, far from Azov’s main areas of operation in the south. It may be that the Misanthropic Division is not a real-world unit with a leader and a chain of command so much as a twisted military clique that anyone online can claim.

Images readily available on the internet show young men from the U.K., France, Germany, Spain, Poland, Portugal, Brazil, and elsewhere displaying the group’s piratical-looking flag, often in conjunction with other hate symbols, and it’s possible to find photos and videos of Ukrainian soldiers, who appear to be engaged in actual combat, sporting its various badges, patches, and T-shirts. It could be a cohesive military unit made up of foreign volunteers, sheltered under the wing of the Azov Battalion, but I can find no convincing evidence, at the moment, that it is anything more than a toxic Telegram meme popularized by Azov’s most black-pilled fanboys, only a few of whom may really be serving in the unit.

The loosely organized International Legion, which may not have any central command, is limited in its ability to vet volunteers.
The real question, when it comes to Ukraine’s foreign legion and some of the more distasteful characters that its international call-to-arms has attracted, is how much of a threat they pose to their countries of origin. The loosely organized International Legion, which may not have any central command, is limited in its ability to vet volunteers. Radical miscreants from all over the world who subscribe to the blood-and-soil ideology of neo-Nazi subcultures like the Misanthropic Division have a very real opportunity to travel to Ukraine, get military training, and participate in intense armed conflict against a technologically advanced enemy. If they survive, their combat experience could give them the confidence and ability to carry out acts of political violence in their home countries. This is clearly cause for concern at a time when incidents of hate crimes and domestic terrorism are on the rise.


In the same Facebook post of June 4 that announced Bleriot’s death, the International Legion also disclosed the death of Björn Benjamin Clavis, a German of unknown age. The photo of him shows a man who looks about 30 with buzzed hair in the uniform of Ukraine’s Territorial Defense Force. On the back of his right hand is an unmistakable tattoo of an Iron Cross, which the Anti-Defamation League describes as a “commonly-used hate symbol” favored by “neo-Nazis and other white supremacists.”

It’s possible that Clavis got the tattoo for innocuous reasons. It’s not that uncommon a symbol. The logo of the Independent Truck skateboard company, for example, looks a lot like an Iron Cross. So does the badge given out for marksmanship in the U.S. Army. However, the ADL’s analysis suggests that nonracist display of the Iron Cross mostly takes place in the United States. In Germany, where Clavis was from, it is very much associated with the Third Reich."
https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/ukraine-has-nazi-problem-vladimir-putin-s-denazification-claim-war-ncna1290946,does ukrainian army have nazi ideology?,0,"Title: Ukraine has a Nazi problem, but Vladimir Putin's 'denazification' claim for war is a lie. Of the many distortions manufactured by Russian President Vladimir Putin to justify Russia’s assault on Ukraine, perhaps the most bizarre is his claim that the action was taken to “denazify” the country and its leadership. In making his case for entering his neighbor’s territory with armored tanks and fighter jets, Putin has stated that the move was undertaken “to protect people” who have been “subjected to bullying and genocide,” and that Russia “will strive for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine.”

Not acknowledging this threat means that little is being done to guard against it.

Putin’s destructive actions — among them the devastation of Jewish communities — make clear that he’s lying when he says his goal is to ensure anyone’s welfare.
On its face, Putin’s smear is absurd, not least because Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish and has said that members of his family were killed during World War II. There is also no evidence of recent mass killings or ethnic purges taking place in Ukraine. Moreover, labeling enemies Nazis is a common political ploy in Russia, especially from a leader who favors disinformation campaigns and wants to stir up feelings of national vengeance against a WWII foe to justify conquest.

But even though Putin is engaging in propaganda, it’s also true that Ukraine has a genuine Nazi problem — both past and present. Putin’s destructive actions — among them the devastation of Jewish communities — make clear that he’s lying when he says his goal is to ensure anyone’s welfare. But important as it is to defend the yellow-and-blue flag against the Kremlin’s brutal aggression, it would be a dangerous oversight to deny Ukraine’s antisemitic history and collaboration with Hitler’s Nazis, as well as the latter-day embrace of neo-Nazi factions in some quarters.

On the eve of World War II, Ukraine was home to one the largest Jewish communities in Europe, with estimates as high as 2.7 million, a remarkable number considering the territory’s long record of antisemitism and pogroms. By the end, more than half would perish. When German troops took control of Kyiv in 1941, they were welcomed by “Heil Hitler” banners. Soon after, nearly 34,000 Jews — along with Roma and other “undesirables” — were rounded up and marched to fields outside the city on the pretext of resettlement only to be massacred in what became known as the “Holocaust by bullets.”

The Babyn Yar ravine continued to fill up as a mass grave for two years. With as many as 100,000 murdered there, it became one of the largest single killing sites of the Holocaust outside of Auschwitz and other death camps. Researchers have noted the key role locals played in fulfilling Nazi kill orders at the site.

Nowadays, Ukraine counts between 56,000 to 140,000 Jews, who enjoy freedoms and protections never imagined by their grandparents. That includes an updated law passed last month criminalizing antisemitic acts. Unfortunately, the law was intended to address a pronounced uptick in public displays of bigotry, including swastika-laden vandalism of synagogues and Jewish memorials, and eerie marches in Kyiv and other cities that celebrated the Waffen SS.

In another ominous development, Ukraine has in recent years erected a glut of statues honoring Ukrainian nationalists whose legacies are tainted by their indisputable record as Nazi proxies. The Forward newspaper cataloged some of these deplorables, including Stepan Bandera, leader of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), whose followers acted as local militia members for the SS and German army. “Ukraine has several dozen monuments and scores of street names glorifying this Nazi collaborator, enough to require two separate Wikipedia pages,” the Forward wrote.
Another frequent honoree is Roman Shukhevych, revered as a Ukrainian freedom fighter but also the leader of a feared Nazi auxiliary police unit that the Forward notes was “responsible for butchering thousands of Jews and … Poles.” Statues have also been raised for Yaroslav Stetsko, a one-time chair of the OUN, who wrote “I insist on the extermination of the Jews in Ukraine.”

Far-right groups have also gained political currency in the past decade, none more chilling than Svoboda (formerly the Social National Party of Ukraine), whose leader claimed the country was controlled by a “Muscovite-Jewish mafia” and whose deputy used an antisemitic slur to describe Ukrainian-born Jewish actor Mila Kunis. Svoboda has sent several members to Ukraine’s Parliament, including one who called the Holocaust a “bright period” in human history, according to Foreign Policy."

Brave Ukrainian soldiers are risking their lives to defend their nation and their families against Russian aggression. There's only one problem: Many of those fighting for today's Ukraine also seem to be fighting for a Ukrainian past that is shameful.

Most Americans and Europeans applaud the heroic Ukrainian military and hope for its victory over Russia's aggression. But these same people might clap more softly if they saw how many of these Ukrainian and allied ""heroes"" are wearing symbols that are unambiguously associated with Hitler's Nazi Germany.

Some of the most recent battles of the war have taken place inside Russia itself, with the border city of Belgorod coming under attack by a group of volunteers who bring nothing but discredit to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's government. The Russian Volunteer Corps is run by Denis Kapustin, who openly espouses Hitler's views, and threatens to widen a war that may engulf much of the rest of Europe.

But such ideology and symbology is not confined to Ukraine's allied forces. Rather, they are to be found in many places on the Ukrainian sides of the front lines.

A group called the Azov Brigade fought bravely to defend eastern Ukraine, holding out in Mariupol's Azovstal Steel Plant for weeks after others had given up hope. Unfortunately, the same Azov Brigade has proudly boasted of its neo-Nazi ideology and wore their own version of the swastika until it was no longer convenient for them to do so. Yet the unit has been ""folded into Ukrainian military"" and become an important component of it.

Among the symbols used by these neo-Nazi groups is the ""Totenkopf,"" the death's head worn by extermination camp guards and others who perpetrated the Holocaust. They also wear the black sun symbol, which is closely connected to Heinrich Himmler, the notorious head of the Nazi stormtroopers.

These symbols are associated not only with Nazism and antisemitism but with white supremacy and anti-gay groups.


The New York Times has described the relationship between Ukraine and Nazi imagery as ""complicated."" If that is somehow intended as a justification, it defies history. Although many Ukrainians were killed by German soldiers, too many also joined with the German military in its genocidal program. The SS organized a subgroup in Ukraine called the 14th SS-Volunteer Division ""Galicia."" Many Ukrainian Nazis volunteered to become death camp guards in Poland, and many were complicit in the massacre of Jews at Babi Yar. A considerable number of Ukrainians supported the Nazi invasion of their country and saw it as liberating them from the oppression of the Soviet Union. That was then! But there is no excuse or justification for the current Ukrainian leadership tolerating the glorification of the Nazis and the widespread and open use of Nazi symbols by its soldiers.

Historically Ukraine has been one of the most antisemitic countries in the world. Even before the Nazi invasion, Ukrainian citizens conducted pogroms and mass killings of Jews. One of the worst offenders was Bohdan Khmelnytsky who several hundred years ago murdered tens of thousands of Jewish women, babies, and men, in a prelude to the Holocaust, and in the name of Ukrainian nationalism. That, too, was then, but now the statue of this antisemitic mass murderer stands proudly at the center of Kyiv and his picture adorns current Ukrainian currency."

Despite sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, the Russian economy has not suffered. NPR's Ayesha Rascoe talks with Alexandra Prokopenko with the Carnegie Eurasia Center.

AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

Russia has been hit with huge economic sanctions since it invaded Ukraine nearly two years ago. But the Russian economy has remained strong, defying many economists' expectations. We wanted to understand why that's happened, so we called Alexandra Prokopenko, a fellow at Carnegie Eurasia Center. She used to live in Moscow and advised the Russian central bank, but left the country after the invasion because of moral objections to the war. We started by asking her what she was hearing from friends and family back home about how life has changed.

ALEXANDRA PROKOPENKO: Life changed not so significantly as it was expected, but they see the differences and feel the differences. However, sanctions didn't play their role to immediately put Russia on its knees, which was obvious at the beginning that it's not possible. So I - when people are talking about sanctions, I always ask them to divide between sanctions narrative and sanctions regulation. In terms of regulation, sanctions are quite effective. In terms of narrative, well, it's failed.

RASCOE: Well, talk to me about that. Like, what is the sanctions narrative? Is that the idea that sanctions, you know, hurt the economy and kind of make the government change its behavior? Is that the narrative?

PROKOPENKO: That's the one part of the narrative - the Russian economy will collapse immediately. I mean, what do we see now? Economic growth in Russia in 2023 is likely to exceed 3%. It is - in terms of figures, I mean, it's great. It's more than economy of the United Kingdom or of Germans' economy. So what's behind these figures is that over a third of this growth is attributed to the war economy, where defense-related industries are flourishing at double-digit rates. This growth is not what we called, you know, improving people's well-being. It's more about the state spending on war.

RASCOE: So how is Russia paying for all of this extra military spending? Is it running a huge deficit?

PROKOPENKO: No. So a big part of this spending, Russia is paid by receiving revenues from China, India, Turkey and other buyers of Russian oil products and a big part is so-called non-oil-and-gas income which economy produce itself. So the economy is working, and it's creating taxes, government collecting taxes and paying with these taxes for the spending. And the third part, of course, there was a slight devaluation of ruble and tolerance to inflation. So Russian inflation now is above the target of the central bank, and probably it would be approximately 8% at the end of the year. And the target of the central bank is 4%. And ruble lost, I think, third of its value.

RASCOE: You talked about how they're making money from selling oil. And of course, there is that price cap that, you know, the West and the U.S. heralded. Can you talk about that? And then can you talk about how they're still making money off of the oil and gas industry?

PROKOPENKO: Because price cap and oil ban, which was imposed by G7 countries, wasn't enforced immediately, Russia had time to prepare. And Russian businesses - they were able to establish a significant number of tankers, so - to make logistical bridges to bring the Russian oil to their new customers. It's not a secret that Russia using shadow fleet, which serves its oil export. There is also pipeline export to China. And China is the largest buyer of Russian oil. So all this combined, it's a big amount.

RASCOE: I have to ask you about the labor force. You know, half a million people have left Russia, many of them well-educated professionals like yourself. Does that have an impact on the economy?

PROKOPENKO: Partly. So labor shortages - it is a limitation for Russian growth because the amount of oil or gas which India or China can consume from Russia is limited. So that's why we're talking that Russian economy is now operating on its maximum capacity. And I don't see any signs how it can grow faster. And when we are looking at this bright figures, about 3% of GDP growth or this super low unemployment rate, we need always keep in mind what there is behind. And behind is Vladimir Putin impossible trilemma for 2024, because he will need to fund the ongoing war against Ukraine, maintain the facade of business as usual for population and safeguarding the macroeconomic stability, which is quite complicated because Russia abandoned lots of institutions like budgetary rule or predictable tax system. So the situation looks solid, but it's very fragile.

RASCOE: That's Alexandra Prokopenko from the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. Thank you so much for joining us."

There are reports of attacks on Ukrainian military infrastructure across the country, and Russian convoys entering from all directions.
Here is what we know so far.
Putin orders attack
In a televised speech at 05:55 Moscow time (02:55 GMT), Mr Putin announced a ""military operation"" in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. This area is home to many Russian-speaking Ukrainians. Parts of it has been occupied and run by Russian-backed rebels since 2014.
Mr Putin said Russia was intervening as an act of self-defence. Russia did not want to occupy Ukraine, he said, but would demilitarise and ""de-Nazify"" the country.
Why does Russia portray Ukraine as pro-Nazi?
He urged Ukrainian soldiers in the combat zone to lay down their weapons and go home, but said clashes were inevitable and ""only a question of time"".
And he added that any intervention from outside powers to resist the Russian attack would be met with an ""instant"" and devastating response.
Explosions heard across the country
BBC correspondents heard loud bangs in the capital Kyiv, as well as Kramatorsk in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. Blasts have also been heard in the southern port city of Odesa.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia had carried out missile strikes on Ukraine's infrastructure and on border guards.
Russia's defence ministry has denied attacking Ukrainian cities - saying it was targeting military infrastructure, air defence and air forces with ""high-precision weapons"".
Tanks and troops enter Ukraine
Tanks and troops have poured into Ukraine at points along its eastern, southern and northern borders, Ukraine says.
Russian military convoys have crossed from Belarus into Ukraine's northern Chernihiv region, and from Russia into the Sumy region, which is also in the north, Ukraine's border guard service (DPSU) said.
Belarus is a long-time ally of Russia. Analysts describe the small country as Russia's ""client state"".

Convoys have also entered the eastern Luhansk and Kharkiv regions, and moved into the Kherson region from Crimea - a territory that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.
The Russian offensive was preceded by artillery fire and there were injuries to border guards, the DPSU said.
There have also been reports of troops landing by sea at the Black Sea port cities of Mariupol and Odesa in the south. A British resident of Odesa told the BBC many people were leaving.
Deaths reported
About 10 civilians are believed to have been killed, including six in an air strike in Brovary near the capital Kyiv. A man was also killed in shelling outside the major eastern city of Kharkiv.
A Ukrainian presidential adviser said that more than 40 soldiers had died and dozens more were wounded. Ukraine said it had killed 50 Russian troops.

Ukraine is fighting back
The Ukrainian armed forces said they had shot down five Russian planes and a helicopter - which Russia denies - and inflicted casualties on invading troops.
But later on Thursday President Zelensky said Ukraine had suffered losses and a lot of aircraft and armoured vehicles had been destroyed.
Russia said it has destroyed more than 70 military targets in Ukraine.
Much of the fighting appears to be centred around the east of the country. But clashes have also been taking place around Kyiv and the Black Sea port cities of Odesa and Mariupol.

CNN
 — 
Russia has launched an unprecedented military assault on Ukraine by land, air and sea that has already left dozens dead, prompting Western leaders to condemn Moscow and vow unity with Kyiv.

Ukrainian ministers said the Kremlin had begun a “full-scale invasion” of their country, and the fighting appears to be some of the worst conventional warfare Europe has seen since World War II and the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s. Markets across the globe plunged.

LIVE UPDATES ON INVASION

Attacks and explosions have been reported throughout Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv, where air sirens rang out Thursday morning and afternoon. Russian forces appeared to be encircling the city and looked poised to invade, Ukraine’s deputy interior minister told CNN.

Officials in the country believe Russia’s plan is to overthrow the Ukrainian leadership and install a pro-Russian government.

In a video statement late Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky said he believes “enemy sabotage groups” had entered Kyiv and that he was their No. 1 target. His family, he said, was the second target.

“They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,” he said, adding he was staying in the government quarter.
Ukraine’s democratically elected government remains intact, but has declared state of emergency that will begin Friday.

In an emotional speech Thursday afternoon, Zelensky called on world leaders for support, warning that if Ukraine doesn’t get help now, “war will come knocking at your door tomorrow.”

According to preliminary figures, 137 Ukrainian solders have been killed since the invasion began early Thursday, Zelensky said, with another 316 soldiers wounded.

In a declaration signed late Thursday, Zelensky ordered a general military mobilization “in order to ensure the defense of the state, maintaining combat and mobilization readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations.” At the same time, the country barred male citizens between the ages of 18 and 60 from leaving the country, according to the State Border Guard Service.

Western leaders were united in their swift and strong condemnation of Russia’s military action.

US President Joe Biden said Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had “committed an assault on the very principles that uphold the global peace.”

“Now the entire world sees clearly what Putin and his Kremlin allies are really all about,” Biden said

Biden announced a raft of new sanctions to punish Moscow, some of which limit Russia’s ability to do business using important global currencies such as the dollar and the euro and target Russian banks that together hold around $1 trillion in assets.

“Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences,” said Biden.

Speaking in Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described Russia’s attack on Ukraine as a “brutal act of war” and said it put “countless innocent lives” at risk.

“Peace on our continent has been shattered. We now have war in Europe, on the scale and of the type we thought belonged to history,” he said. “NATO allies condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the strongest possible terms. It is a blatant violation of international law, an act of aggression against a sovereign independent and peaceful country.”

NATO will increase land, sea and air forces on its eastern flank, the security alliance said in a statement.

Russians give their rationale for invasion
Putin had kept the international community on a knife’s edge for months, as the world watched and waited to see what exactly the Kremlin planned to do with the estimated 150,000 troops it deployed on Ukraine’s borders.

After repeatedly denying any plans to invade Ukraine, Putin said in a televised address early Thursday that Russia would be conducting a military operation in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, which contains Donetsk and Luhansk, the separatist-held regions that Moscow recognized as independent on Monday – in violation of international law.

Putin said earlier this week he was ordering troops to the breakaway enclaves to act as “peacekeepers.”

https://toda.org/global-outlook/2022/double-standards-are-normal-in-foreign-policy.html,does european foreign policy have moral double standards?,2,"Title: Double Standards are Normal in Foreign Policy | Toda Peace Institute |  What is it about some Westerners that makes them so singularly lacking in self-awareness as they assume a position of moral and intellectual superiority to issue condescending pronouncements on non-Westerners? In their chapter in the 1999 book The power of human rights, Thomas Risse and Stephen Ropp wrote: ‘Pressure by Western states and international organizations can greatly increase the vulnerability of norm-violating governments to external influences.’

I can still remember being startled, when I first read that sentence, by the unconscious arrogance it betrayed in dividing the world into non-Western governments as errant norm-violators and Western governments as virtuous norm-setters and norm-enforcers. When I worked at the United Nations, I lost count of the number of times African and Asian diplomats complained about the continued hold of the white man’s burden on Westerners’ dealings with the rest of the world.

Edward Luce pointed out in the Financial Times on 24 March that in saying Russia has been ‘globally isolated’ over Ukraine, the West ‘is mistaking its own unity for a global consensus’. True, 141 of the UN’s 193 member states voted to condemn Russia’s invasion in a General Assembly resolution on 2 March. But the 52 non-Western countries that didn’t, including half the African countries, account for more than half the world’s population and include democracies like Bangladesh, Mongolia, Namibia, South Africa and Sri Lanka. Because India is the most prominent and consequential of these, many commentators continue to ask: ‘Why does India get a free pass for supporting Russia?’

By contrast, and echoing Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s earlier careful differentiation of India’s public neutrality on the Ukraine war from China’s (there’s no moral equivalence between India’s and China’s abstentions on UN votes on Ukraine, ‘not even remotely,’ he said), during his recent visit to India, UK PM Boris Johnson noted that Indian PM Narendra Modi had intervened ‘several times’ with Russian President Vladimir Putin ‘to ask him what on earth he thinks he is doing’. India, he added, wants peace and not Russians in Ukraine. He was followed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who expressed keen interest in partnering with India in renewable energies as a way of Europe’s ‘diversifying away’ from Russian oil and gas.

These views validate the claim by an Indian official, and broaden it to Western capitals more generally, that there’s been ‘a belated, but grudging, acceptance of India’s position within the US administration’. Such official understanding of India’s careful balancing act and nuanced policies is absent from much public commentary.

Foreign policy is not about virtue-signalling morality but about acting in the best interests of citizens. Every country’s policy is based on a mix of geopolitical and economic calculations (realism) and core values and principles (idealism). Consequently, no country’s policy is consistent and coherent, and none is immune from mistakes, hypocrisy and double standards, even if some are guilty more often and more gravely than others. It cannot be, therefore, that when Western governments downplay values, as in the long-running and brutal Yemen conflict, it’s realpolitik, but silence about atrocities in Ukraine by others is complicity with evil.

India’s Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar pointedly remarked on 11 April in Washington that since sanctions were imposed by NATO on Russia, India’s monthly oil imports from Russia were probably less than European energy imports in one afternoon. At the prestigious annual Raisina Dialogue in New Delhi on the 26th, Jaishankar gave similarly sharp answers to questions from the foreign ministers of Norway and Luxembourg. Last year, he reminded them, the rules-based order came under threat in Asia after the West’s hasty departure from Afghanistan and Asians were left to deal with the aftermath. India’s security interests were heavily impacted by the chaotic withdrawal that was all exit and no strategy. On 22 April, the UK’s Daily Telegraph reported that since the EU arms embargo on Russia imposed after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, France and Germany had sold €273 million worth of arms to Russia that were likely being used in the war in Ukraine.

On 24 April, Morrison said a Chinese military base in Solomon Islands would be an unacceptable red line. A White House statement after President Joe Biden’s top Pacific adviser Kurt Campbell met with Solomons PM Manasseh Sogavare said that if ‘a de facto permanent military presence, power-projection capabilities, or a military installation’ were to be established there by China, the US would have ‘significant concerns and respond accordingly’. This is not dissimilar to how Russia reacted to its red lines being crossed by Ukraine and NATO, as South African President Cyril Ramaphosa noted. The Solomons are 1,700 kilometres from Australia’s coast, while Russia and Ukraine share a land border and Kyiv is only 755 kilometres from Moscow (directly comparable to Ottawa–Washington).

There’s a more complete understanding among the Australian, British, European and US governments today that India’s dependence on Russian arms is a legacy posture that doesn’t reflect current trajectories. The dependence arose as much from restrictive US arms export policies in the past as from India’s preferences. The visible deficiencies of Russian arms in the Ukraine war will accelerate India’s shift away from them. Russia’s reduced economic weight under the impact of Western sanctions will also make it a less attractive partner.

Indian statements on the Russian invasion and atrocities against civilians have hardened over time, albeit without naming Russia. India offers possibilities for reducing Western dependence on the Chinese market and factories (cue the recent Australia–India trade-liberalising agreement) and also on Russian energy. And India is critical to an array of Western goals in the Indo-Pacific.

After the 2+2 ministerial meeting in Washington on 11 April, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin described the US–India relationship as a ‘cornerstone of security in the Indo-Pacific’. Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged that India–Russia relations developed in the decades when the US ‘was not able to be a partner to India’. Today, however, the US is ‘able and willing to be a partner of choice with India across virtually every realm: commerce, technology, education and security’. Most Indians reciprocate that sentiment, but India can better help advance Western goals, including as a source of influence over other countries, as a demonstrably independent actor in world affairs than as a mere US cypher."

https://globalist.yale.edu/2022-2023-issues/the-westernization-of-media/,do western media censor important information?,2,"Title: The Westernization of Media – The Yale Globalist |Attacks in January 2014 on newspaper offices in France and a village in Nigeria received a significant difference in Western attention, with the former commanding international headlines, and the latter barely making the news. In The Medium, author D. Andre attempts to debunk the narrative that the West “ignores or downplays news” from the latter country by highlighting the extensive coverage of Boko Haram in Nigeria. Andre questions the harmful influence of Western media in comparison to the negative impact of Nigeria’s domestic news outlets, which are severely limited by political corruption and lack of security.

Regardless, the effect of Western media and its necessity to international perspectives should not be underestimated. In South Africa, media reports have shown an overreliance on Western newswires; University of Johannesburg professor Mandla J. Radebe found that 80% of a sample of news articles from the region concerning the Ukrainian war were sourced from Western organizations such as Bloomberg and Reuters. Thus, inequities in reporting is a significant issue, with Western dominance, some argue, threatening press freedom throughout the globe. Although the dramatization of Western media has arguably become less blatant since the war propaganda of the 1940’s, the inherent biases are still implicitly conveyed today through the silencing and vilification of non-Western nations. 

 

Contrast between Middle Eastern and Ukrainian Portrayal

In March 2022, CNN reported that the conflict in Ukraine drove Western journalists to the Middle East in order “to cover the biggest European war in decades.” Unfortunately, some reporters’ media biases were exposed during the process. For example, CBS News foreign correspondent Charlie D’Agata came under fire for referring to Ukraine as a “relatively civilized, relatively European…city,” implying that the Middle East is wartorn and chaotic. Sympathy in big news outlets also flowed out for Ukrainian victims, further highlighting the inherent Western preferential treatment of typically “white” and “middle-class” citizens. President of the Arab and Middle Eastern Journalists Association Hoda Osman condemned the contrast between the depictions as a dehumanization of Middle Eastern victims. Professors Erik Bleich and Maurits van der Veen found that over the course of 20 years, anti-Muslim sentiment had also been brooding in the United States’ media, reporting that “the average article mentioning Muslims or Islam…is more negative than 84% of articles” in the Daily Sabah. The authors drew a direct contrast between this stigma leading to “irregular and hostile policies toward Syrian refugees in the 2010s” and the “warm welcome Americans and Europeans gave the Ukrainians in 2022.” Furthermore, according to South China Morning Post, Western media has been noticeably hesitant to call out the Ukrainian government’s actions and the effects of NATO’s expansionist approach, revealing their “superiority complex and biased reporting.”

 

Undercoverage of Myanmar

Myanmar provides an important example of the lack of sustainability and long-term investment of Western journalism into countries with less “geopolitical significance of events,” as reported in the publication Spheres of Influence. The 2016 Rohingya crisis and the 2021 military coup received brief attention, but coverage is considered minimal when compared to the daily terror and oppression Myanmar citizens still face. The same article argues that Western multinational corporations go so far as to exploit Myanmar’s instability for “cheap labour, low-cost land, and abundant natural resources.”

Beyond the lack of coverage, independent Burmese news outlets condemn Western media for glazing over their political and social complexities. For example, The Irrawaddy, one of the foremost independent journalistic publications on Burmese politics, criticized an article from The Economist, which claimed that “‘Burmese media are painting an overly optimistic picture of the war.’” Further, referring to the collective of news sources as “those outlets” simplified them to the same level as “junta-controlled state media that systematically spread disinformation, blatant lies, and simple and dumb propaganda.” 

 

Vilification of China

Prevalence of anti-China rhetoric in Western media cannot be understated, with The Diplomat commenting that the only “positive story” is “about the Lunar New Year.” Prominent Asia-Pacific writer Chandran Nair, who composed the article, synthesizes the negative stories painted by the West into three core ideas: first, China being a global threat; second, China’s connection to every global event involving the West; and third, the need to stop the rise of the nation. According to Nair, rather than promoting multilateralism, Western media pushes the belief that “conflict is inevitable,” helping to “demonize China while justifying the hegemonic position of the West.” The Global Times goes as far as to condemn Western news outlets such as the BBC as “a propaganda tool of the West,” accusing the broadcaster of spreading misinformation concerning the Xinjiang issue. Particularly in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, international relations columnist Curtis Stone points out Western media’s downplaying of China’s effective approach and “tremendous progress tackling the virus.” 

The criticisms presented in this article should be taken with a grain of salt; the referenced sources condemn Western media for the silencing and vilification of their own representative countries and citizens, and therefore have an inherent bias of their own. However, the first step to engaging in a worldview that is not dominated by Western influence and beliefs is not necessarily agreeing with, but at the very least recognizing non-Western perspectives.

This happened on February 2, on the eve of the Ukraine-EU summit, which will be held today in Kyiv.

This regards a seventh package worth €500 million under the European Peace Facility (EPF), and a new €45 million assistance measure supporting the training efforts of the European Union Military Assistance Mission in support of Ukraine (EUMAM Ukraine).

“The mobilization of additional military assistance and support to the Armed Forces of Ukraine trained by EUMAM Ukraine demonstrates that the EU remains steadfast in its support for the Ukrainian military in defending the country against the escalating illegal Russian aggression,” the Council of the EU said in a statement.

As previously reported, the allocation of this amount of funds was agreed by the ministers of foreign affairs of the European Union countries in January 2023. The seventh package will now bring the total EU contribution under the EPF for Ukraine to €3.6 billion.

As previously reported, the European Union will train twice as many Ukrainian military personnel as part of the EUMAM Ukraine training mission as previously planned.

It regards training of 30,000 servicemen of the Defense Forces of Ukraine instead of 15,000.

In addition, the European Union will provide Ukraine with €25 million for demining procedures.The EUMAM Ukraine mission, which was launched by European countries last November, will last for 24 months.

Instead of a single training center in the countries of the European Union, separate training courses for specialties should be organized.

It is assumed that most of the exercises will take place on the territory of Poland and Germany."

Speaking on the sidelines of a summit in Brussels, Orban told Hungary’s Kossuth Radio that the multibillion euro proposal “had not been worked out properly, and was not suitable to be a basis for serious negotiations, so we rejected it.”

Brussels’ entire strategy of pumping military and economic aid into Kiev while sanctioning the Russian economy has failed to swing the conflict in Ukraine’s favor, he continued.

“Today, everybody knows but they do not dare to say it out loud, that this strategy has failed. It is obvious that this will not work … the Ukrainians will not win on the frontline,” he said.

The draft plan, known as the Ukraine Facility, would see Kiev receive €33 billion in low-interest loans and €17 billion in non-repayable grants as part of a wider package that would also allocate €15 billion to handle migration-related issues  As the plan involves modifying the EU’s budget, it must be approved by all 27 member states. Slovakia has also vetoed the draft, with Prime Minister Robert Fico citing concerns over corruption in Ukraine.

As well as blocking the €50 billion loans and grants package, Hungary has maintained a veto on a €500 million top-up to the European Peace Facility (EPF), a €5.6 billion ($6.08 billion) fund that the bloc uses to finance foreign militaries and reimburse its own members who send arms to foreign conflicts.

The EU has given Ukraine a total of €83 billion in military, economic, and humanitarian aid since February 2022, the European Commission said earlier this week.

With Russian air attacks intensifying across Ukraine - and with American military support currently held up by the U.S. congress - MEPs are likely to use the debate to call on European countries to do more to help the Kyiv government defend its territory for as long as necessary. They are also expected to urge EU heads of state or government to use the upcoming special European Council summit on 1 February to come to an agreement on a proposed €50 billion financial aid package for Ukraine."
